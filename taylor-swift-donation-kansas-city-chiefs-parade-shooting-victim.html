With love, Taylor Swift,” the donation reads.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift was in attendance at the Super Bowl on Sunday, and watched her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, claim victory against the San Francisco 49ers. Following the parade shooting, Kelce was among the <a href=#>NFL players to lead tributes to the victims.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kelce made his own $100,000 donation, paid in two $50,000 instalments via his <a href=#>Eighty-Seven & Running</a> organization, to a <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> page set up for the Reyes family, whose two young daughters were <a href=#>shot in the legs at the parade</a>. The aim of the fund is to "help provide vital financial support for their physical and mental recovery."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kc.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift's donation went to a GoFundMe page set up Thursday afternoon to provide “vital financial support” with a goal of raising $75,000 for the late Lopez-Galvan’s family. At the time of going to press, the fund had eclipsed $330,000. “Lisa was celebrating the Chiefs’ Super Bowl Victory parade when senselessly killed,” wrote the organizer of the fund.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She is survived by two children and her husband of 22 years. She was an amazing mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, and friend to so many. We ask that you continue to keep her family in your prayers as we grieve the loss of her life. This fund will help provide vital financial support to her family as they process this unthinkable tragedy. Any amount is appreciated.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lopez-Galvan, 43, was the co-host of a Latin music program, “Taste of Tejano,” on KKFI, a community radio station. She was attending the parade with her husband and children when the shooting occurred. Three other family members, including her son, <a href=#>reportedly in his early 20s</a>, were also injured.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Twenty-two people were injured in the shooting as the parade at Kansas City’s historic Union Station wrapped up, with Lopez-Galvan being the sole fatality. Half of the victims are under the age of 16, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said in a news conference Thursday. Three suspects were arrested. On Friday afternoon, it was announced that <a href=#>two juveniles have been charged</a> in connection to the mass shooting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbmlqhnd%2Fjq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2acn6OutbXOp2SkmZ6orrR5wqKrsmWTnbamstJmp5qqkZmybr%2FHqKatoZ6cere1wq2gpmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
