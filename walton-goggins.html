Goggins' first role was a small part in the television series "In the Heat of the Night" in 1989. During the '90s and early 2000s, Goggins acted in many movies (such as 1994's "The Next Karate Kid," 1998's "Major League: Back to the Minors" and 2000's "Shanghai Noon") and television shows (including 1995's "JAG," 1996's "Pacific Blue" and 1998's "NYPD Blue.") These smaller parts led to his breakout role as Det. Shane Vendrell in "The Shield," which ran from 2002–2008. Goggins followed that with another signature role, playing Boyd Crowder in the modern western "Justified" from 2010–2015. Goggins then shifted to a more comedic lane, leading the HBO series "Vice Principals" opposite Danny McBride for two seasons, from 2016 — 2017. In 2019, Goggins joined the dark comedy series "The Righteous Gemstones" as Baby Billy Freeman. Contemporaneously, Goggins starred in the Amazon series "Fallout" and the third season of the anthology series "The White Lotus." Goggins also remained active in film roles as well, with some key parts including 2002's "The Bourne Identity," 2003's "House of 1000 Corpses" and 2008's "Miracle at St. Anna." In 2012, Goggins appeared in two high-profile hits: "Lincoln" and "Django Unchained." From there, his film roles have included another Tarantino film (2015's "The Hateful Eight"), a video game adaptation (2018's "Tomb Raider") and a Marvel movie (2018's "Ant-Man and the Wasp"). In 2011, Goggins was nominated for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series at the Emmys for his work on "Justified." He also starred in and co-produced "The Accountant," which won the Academy Award for best live-action short film in 2002.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfLity62mp2WXpLSotc2sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
