After weeks of The Battle Rounds, the show showed their few final Battles, before moving on into the Knockout Rounds. This is the first episode featuring Season 24’s Mega Mentor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wynonna Judd.</a></strong></p><p>The episode began with a Team Niall battle, featuring Huntley and Brailey Lenderman. Superfans of the series were able to see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this Battle</a> ahead of time, on The Voice‘s YouTube channel. Following their impressive rendition of “Hold My Hand” by Hootie & the Blowfish, coach Niall Horan picked Huntley as the winner of the Battle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-legend-steals-team-gwen-singer>John Legend Steals Team Gwen Singer</h2><p>The final Battle of the season featured Team Gwen singers Brandon Montel and Kara Tanae. Their coach, Gwen Stefani chose the song “Have You Ever” by Brandy as their Battle song.</p><p>This song was perfect for both singers, since it showed off both of their soulful sides. It was genuinely hard to decide which singer did better, since they were both showing off in this performance, in the best way possible.</p><p>It’s important to remember that Brandon had a Four-Chair turn audition to H.E.R.’s “Hard Place,” while Kara turned the chairs of Reba McEntire, Horan, and Stefani with her rendition of Ella Mai’s “Boo’d Up.” Following Stefani’s tough decision, she announced Kara as the winner of the Battle. Luckily, Brandon’s time on the series is not over yet. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Legend</a> chose to hit his steal button as the singer was exiting the stage.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Have you ever watched a more stunning performance from <a href=#>@Brandon_Montel</a> and Kara Tenae?! 🌟 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QANgh0v0p8</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>November 7, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-reba-impresses-in-3-way-knockout>Team Reba Impresses in 3-Way Knockout</h2><p>The three-way Knockout Round featured <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Reba</a> members Alison Albrecht, Jacquie Roar, and Tom Nitti. The singers, respectively, performed “It’s Too Late” by Carole King, “Girl” by Maren Morris, and “I Know I’m Losing You” by The Temptations. As a reminder, each singer picks and performs their own song for this round. As this Knockout went on, it was clear that McEntire picked a really great premiere group.</p><p>After hearing the coaches compliment each singer, McEntire picked Jacquie as the winner. Once it was time for Tom to leave the series, McEntire tried to save her artist, but Stefani hit her steal. Tom was able to pick which coach he wanted, and he chose to remain on Team Reba.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jacquie Roar continues to be a SHOWSTOPPING vocalist! 👏 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pIhObIZ2ib</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>November 7, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mara-justine-once-again-brings-down-the-house>Mara Justine Once Again Brings Down The House</h2><p>For Team Legend’s first Knockout, Legend paired Kaylee Shimizu with Caleb Sasser and Mara Justine. The singers, respectively, sang “Ain’t No Way” by Aretha Franklin, “Jealous” by Nick Jonas, and the Mariah Carey version of “Without You” by Harry Nilsson.</p><p>This lineup was quite unbelievable, since it has some of Legend’s best singers. This Knockout progressed in how good the artists were. It began with Caleb, who did his best, but fell flat compared to Kaylee. Kaylee who impressed with several extremely high runs, while Mara honestly gave a show-winning performance. Mara has impressed in each round of the competition, and I think this performance may be very telling.</p><p>Even though Mara was clearly the winner of the battle, Legend picked Kaylee as the winner of the battle. It was shocking that he didn’t pick Mara, since he said this is her best performance yet on the show. As Mara was saying goodbye to her coach, both Horan and Stefani hit their steal buttons. Unfortunately, fans do not know which team Mara has picked. It will be announced at the beginning of the next episode.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We're not gonna be able to get <a href=#>@Marajustine1</a>'s performance of "Without You" by Harry Nilsson out of our heads. 🎤 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iZdaADOsm1</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>November 7, 2023</a><p>The Voice returns to NBC on Tuesday, November 7 at 9 p.m. ET for the next set of Knockout Rounds.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Original_DanandShay_Terry-WyattGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Meet Upcoming ‘The Voice’ Country Coach Duo Dan + Shay" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice recap</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXZeutcDLnqpmnZ6Zeri106FkmmWjqbKiuIykpaibm6TCtb%2BMpKCco12ks6d51qKroWWjnbykt8innmain527brjEoJynnF2ZsqS10qKmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
