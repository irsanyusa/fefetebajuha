That person might be participating in what psychologists call a “codependent relationship.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what you need to know about codependent relationships:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What is a codependent relationship?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In the codependent relationship, one person is doing the bulk of the caring, and often ends up losing themselves in the process,” says Dr. Shawn Burn, author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Unhealthy Helping: A Psychological Guide to Codependence, Enabling, and Other Dysfunctional Giving</a>. Conversely, in a healthy relationship, the give-and-take is relatively balanced and equal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are two opposing roles that each person in a codependent relationship typically plays: the giver and the taker, says Burn. Givers tend to have an incessant, subconscious need to keep their relationship alive; the fear of being alone causes them to overexert themselves physically and emotionally in order to please their partners, according to Burn. Takers, on the other hand, benefit from this dynamic of getting much more than they give. The typical taker lacks maturity, or suffers from an addiction or <a href=#>personality disorder</a>, Burn says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This relationship dynamic forms a cycle that’s not easy to break: The giver continues to overcompensate for his or her partner, while the taker avoids assuming responsibility, according to Burn. They become codependent, relying on each other not for love and care, but for relief from insecurity.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Why do people get into codependent relationships?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To understand how codependent relationships form, it’s important to know the characteristics of people who are predisposed to getting into them. Codependent tendencies often trace back to childhood, when we start to develop patterns in how we connect with people, or what psychologists call “attachment styles,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Dr. Holly Daniels</a>, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A <a href=# rel=noopener>2012 study</a> in The American Journal of Family Therapy found that those who perceived conflict between their parents growing up were more likely to become codependent in adulthood.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The reason you develop an insecure attachment style is because you probably didn’t have secure attachments with your parents,” Daniels says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In codependent relationships, givers have anxious attachment styles—they define themselves by their relationship, and will do whatever it takes to stay in it, according to Daniels. Takers, she says, tend to have avoidant attachment styles, meaning they try to avoid emotional connection at all costs. They make exceptions for anxiously attached people, however, because they get much more out of the relationship than they have to put in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Givers and takers are drawn to each other — often subconsciously, says Daniels. Over time, givers wear themselves out as they fight for the reassurance they may never get from the taker, while the takers continue avoiding their emotions and taking responsibility for their actions.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>How can you tell if you’re in a codependent relationship?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One question you should ask yourself is: how much time in a given day do you spend thinking about your relationship? If the answer is most of the time, Daniels says your relationship is probably codependent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Also, if you are constantly seeking reassurance, asking questions like, “Do you love me? “ and “Do you promise you won’t leave me?,” you may be codependent, according to Daniels.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other signs of codependency include putting your partner on a pedestal, idealizing that person despite his or her faults and making excuses for your loved one when he or she neglects important tasks. Givers often think they’re helping their partners, when in reality they’re actually preventing them from personal growth, Daniels says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And if one partner in your relationship has an addiction, it’s much more likely to become codependent, says Melody Beattie, author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Codependent No More</a>. One partner’s addiction to alcohol or drugs<strong> can</strong> take a toll on both partners, and can cause more imbalances in the relationship. “So can addiction to money, ego, power, lying, or love and sex,” Beattie says. The person with the addiction can neglect his or her partner in the process, while the other may feel the need to give more to that person out of fear, guilt, or habit, according to Beattie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s important to take note of the signs, as codependent relationships can often mimic <a href=#>healthy relationships</a> at first, says Daniels. As time passes, givers become laden with their responsibilities to the takers, and takers become overwhelmed by the giver’s emotional neediness. Without changing course, the relationship will ultimately become unhappy and unsustainable, according to Daniels.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What should you do if you’re in a codependent relationship?</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you’ve noticed traits of codependency in your relationship, Daniels advises seeking professional help. Through therapy, codependent relationships can become more <a href=#>balanced and fulfilling</a>—but both parties need to be committed to making the relationship work, Daniels says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Daniels, who works with codependent couples, says the anxiously attached partner shouldn’t let the fear of losing his or her loved one prevent the suggestion of professional help. “It’s important to take that risk anyway,” Daniels says. “If that person is going to run away, they’re going to run away anyway.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When both partners are on board, Daniels says she helps couples identify their insecure attachment styles, and then advises that they “take opposite action.” For givers, that means learning to be on their own, strengthening their friendships, or focusing on passions outside of their relationship. For takers, it involves taking time to initiate meaningful conversations with their partners and showing more affection.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“People in codependent relationships aren’t bad people,” says Daniels. In fact, most people have some degree of insecure attachment. But the key, she says, is to learn when it’s time to give, take, or walk away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2RuhnODjpymnZ2gmrulsc2tZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2otqi60mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
