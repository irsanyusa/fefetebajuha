Since they’re going into the Playoffs, let’s get to know everything about these sisters.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Sorelle? How Were They Formed?</h2><p>When it comes to trio’s many wonder who the group really came to be. Sisters, Madi, Ana and Bella rose to fame after posting a TikTok cover of “All About That Bass” by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meghan Trainor</a>. The cover even impressed the singer, her “like” and repost helped Sorelle rise to fame.</p><p>Soon after, they appeared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nickelodeon’s</a> America’s Most Musical Family, in 2019. Apparently, the group originally was a duo featuring Madi and Ana, but while they were on the Nickelodeon show, they mentioned to producers that they also had a younger sister. Producers then asked the sisters to film a video of them all singing together, and modern day Sorelle was created! Bella’s first ever performance with her sisters was on national TV on the show.</p><p>Due to their social media popularity, they currently post daily with content featuring, song covers, viral dances, fashion videos, and more. In addition, the sisters appear live 5 days a week for one hour. They currently have 3.2 million followers on the social media platform.</p><p>According to their website, their group name, Sorellé, is Italian for sisters. Since they are proud of their Italian roots and are sisters, they knew the name was perfect for them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-journey-on-the-voice>Their Journey on The Voice</h2><p>Sorelle made their first appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a> singing Queen’s “Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy.” They turned the chairs of both show veteran Blake Shelton, and new coach Chance The Rapper.
