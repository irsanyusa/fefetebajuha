Even men that are usually called the greatest cheats can be faithful.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes it's due to indiscipline or the quest to explore. But there are many people out there who are faithful to their partners and would never cheat on them no matter what.</p><h2>Spicing up relationship, stay respectful</h2><p class=align-left>I will speak to my fellow women on this. Respect your men. Men love respect. If you are a lady finding it difficult to be respectful to your man, you might face problems in your relationship.</p><p class=align-left>Be his peace not a war lord. Some people once they get familiar with you, they start speaking to you anyhow as they deem fit. They start nagging and in the long run your partner begins to get tired. Emotionally he's no longer in the relationship. He starts trying out his luck on other people before officially dissolving the relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/98c2054f0f6cb9c0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ wedding vows for him: Find the right words for your special day</span></p></a><h2>Look attractive and dress well</h2><p class=align-left>I always tell people to take care of themselves more when they get into a relationship. That energy you always put to dress well and capture hearts at a mall or public place, put it in more to make your partner adore you. Know what your partner loves to see and do it often. If your lady loves to see you on jeans, get them. If your man loves off shoulder dresses, get them. It will be impossible to cheat when you always see your partner as a spec.</p><p class=align-left>I have seen people who used to look sweet before marriage suddenly change and begin to look shabby afterwards. This should not be the case. As a man or lady, you need to keep working on yourself and maintain that spark that caught the eyes of your partner.</p><p class=align-left>Although sometimes especially for the woman, your physical changes might be out of your control due to childbirth and other factors, but there's always gym, dieting and other things that would help you stay fit and attractive as you used to be.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7e0d17abf099c363.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ being ignored quotes for when you are feeling overlooked</span></p></a><h2>Have fun with your partner</h2><p class=align-left>Please be playful. Don't be over-serious all the time. All work and no play makes jack a dull boy. I know you are in a serious relationship but you need to make out time to catch fun with your partner.</p><p class=align-left>Girl, make him laugh. Mr man, make her happy. Make una jolly together. These happy moments you create will sustain the relationship when things begin to get tough cause all relationships face problems.</p><h2>Strong emotional connection</h2><p class=align-left>Strive to build and maintain a strong level of emotional connection. It is very necessary in healthy long-lasting relationships.</p><p class=align-left>People want to feel connected to their partner on an emotional level. Being understood, appreciated, and supported. They want a partner who they can rely on and who will be honest with them.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Disclaimer: Advice given in this article is general in nature and is not intended to influence readers' decisions about how to spend on their partners.
