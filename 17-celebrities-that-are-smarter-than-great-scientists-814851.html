At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;13, she already had her<strong> first album</strong>. The average&nbsp;IQ is&nbsp;100, and Shakira has 140, enough for her to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;invitation to&nbsp;Mensa, the world’s oldest high&nbsp;IQ society.</p><p>Any IQ&nbsp;score that goes over 140&nbsp;is considered as&nbsp;entering a&nbsp;genius territory. She never went to&nbsp;<a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a>, but she had a&nbsp;dream of&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;anthropologist, a&nbsp;person who studies people within the present and past societies. Shakira speaks <strong>Spanish, <a href=# title=English data-link=tag>English</a>, French, Arabic, Portuguese, and Italian</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/963/b24/4669215dcfa1800e91a633ee10.png><p><strong>Alicia Keys</strong> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely talented musician and a&nbsp;Grammy winner. She started with classical piano lessons when she was&nbsp;<strong>7</strong>, and after there was nothing left she could learn from her teacher, so&nbsp;she moved to&nbsp;study jazz when she was 14. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;16, she already got a&nbsp;scholarship to&nbsp;Columbia University. Alicia was a&nbsp;straight-A student, but she left the university in&nbsp;the first semester because she wanted to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;her own music. It&nbsp;seemed like the right decision because at&nbsp;that point, her music adventure got to&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new level&nbsp;— she got a&nbsp;contract with Columbia Records by&nbsp;the following year.</p><p><a href=# title="Natalie Portman" data-link=tag>Natalie Portman</a> was only 11&nbsp;years old when she got a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;her first film&nbsp;— which was French. She appeared in&nbsp;theaters as&nbsp;well, won an&nbsp;Oscar for <i>Black Swan</i>. But, even though she’s very successful in&nbsp;it, an&nbsp;acting career has never been her first choice. She also got a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;psychology from Harvard in&nbsp;2003 and has been published in&nbsp;<a href=# title=scientific data-link=tag>scientific</a> journals&nbsp;— <strong>twice</strong>. Natalie can speak 5&nbsp;languages [English, French, Spanish, Hebrew, Japanese] and has an&nbsp;<strong>IQ of&nbsp;140</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/98a/8b0/d5d87e5abe84af481ed3e1a8a5.png><p><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong>, another extremely intelligent celebrity, was always an&nbsp;A student. She was even valedictorian as&nbsp;she was graduating from high school. She was specifically into Science, eventually even got a&nbsp;scholarship to&nbsp;study chemical engineering, but ditched school to&nbsp;start her super modeling career. <a href=# title="Sharon Stone" data-link=tag>Sharon Stone</a> got to&nbsp;the second grade at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;5. Her teachers encouraged her to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;because they noticed how intelligent she was. With an&nbsp;IQ of&nbsp;154 which means she’s in&nbsp;the top 0.1 percent of&nbsp;the world’s smartest population. She was only 15&nbsp;when she got accepted to&nbsp;college&nbsp;— and got a&nbsp;scholarship too. She later studied creative writing and fine arts.</p><p><a href=# title="Ashton Kutcher" data-link=tag>Ashton Kutcher</a> was about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accepted to&nbsp;both Purdue and MIT, where he&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;study engineering. But, he&nbsp;lost the scholarship opportunity since one of&nbsp;his pranks was breaking into his high school. He&nbsp;enrolled in&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Iowa but left it&nbsp;when he&nbsp;was 19&nbsp;to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;model. He&nbsp;has an&nbsp;<strong>IQ of&nbsp;160</strong> and used his intelligence to&nbsp;build himself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;truly hardworking individual&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;worked hard whichever job he&nbsp;had. He&nbsp;has gained valuable life experience through different positions. For example, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;janitor, even ended up&nbsp;working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;butcher.</p><p>His high&nbsp;IQ puts him in&nbsp;the exceptionally gifted category&nbsp;— together with, for example, Einstein, who also had an&nbsp;<strong>IQ of&nbsp;160</strong>. Even though he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;genius, Einstein’s success didn’t come all at&nbsp;once. After he&nbsp;had graduated, he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher for 2&nbsp;years. Physics wasn’t the most important thing for him back then. He&nbsp;was actually passionate about music and couldn’t imagine life without&nbsp;it. Playing the violin and the piano helped him to&nbsp;clear his thoughts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4e7/7cb/b8fa19551bb880035cbb5002ac.png><p>Stephen Hawking was another genius scientist with an<strong>&nbsp;IQ of&nbsp;160</strong> and one of&nbsp;the biggest theoretical physicists of&nbsp;our age. He&nbsp;was the one who claimed our Universe started as&nbsp;an&nbsp;infinitely dense and infinitely small point&nbsp;— which means the Big Bang, the way science today describes how the Universe was formed. He&nbsp;talked a&nbsp;lot about black holes, Hawking radiation&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;the thermal radiation science now believes is&nbsp;emitted by&nbsp;black holes&nbsp;— and many other intriguing things about space.</p><p>Writer, producer, podcaster, television host, and comedian&nbsp;— Conan O’Brien certainly juggles with lots of&nbsp;exciting professions. He&nbsp;graduated from Harvard and was a&nbsp;history and literature major. The school newspaper gave him the title of&nbsp;his class’s “<strong>pre-eminent jokester</strong>”. He’s also a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the “I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;160&nbsp;IQ” club.</p><p>One of ’Friends’ stars, Lisa Kudrow, has an<strong>&nbsp;IQ of&nbsp;154</strong>. She got a&nbsp;bachelor’s degree in&nbsp;Biology and worked with her father for a&nbsp;while since he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;physician. But, she eventually went in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different direction&nbsp;— a&nbsp;popular sitcom was the starting point in&nbsp;her acting career, but she’s also a&nbsp;talented award-nominee producer!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f33/8b7/8ee1df56d99b2337ec4aa73d3f.png><p><strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong> was in&nbsp;many famous movies but is&nbsp;an&nbsp;academic overachiever too! At&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age, she won the prestigious WH&nbsp;Smith Young Writers competition <strong>twice</strong>&nbsp;— once for poetry, another time for fiction. She studied French literature at&nbsp;Oxford, which she enrolled in&nbsp;when she was only 17. She dropped out to&nbsp;start building her acting career. But some time ago, she said she had run into her old French tutor, which made her reconsider going back to&nbsp;school to&nbsp;finish her degree <strong>26&nbsp;years later</strong>.<strong> </strong>Not just Hollywood, take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the sports!</p><p>Tiger Woods has an<strong>&nbsp;IQ of&nbsp;145</strong>. He’s an&nbsp;American golfer and an&nbsp;extremely gifted player who became a&nbsp;prodigy at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age. He&nbsp;was the youngest winner of&nbsp;the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship&nbsp;— it&nbsp;happened in&nbsp;1991, and he&nbsp;was only 15&nbsp;years old. He&nbsp;dropped out of&nbsp;college to&nbsp;chase his dream to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;professional golf player&nbsp;— and later said the only thing he&nbsp;regretted was not spending another year at&nbsp;Stanford, where he&nbsp;had actually studied.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/548/57a/85deff58f5afd6bb43ae44becc.png><p>Quentin Tarantino&nbsp;— another famous person with an&nbsp;<strong>IQ of&nbsp;160</strong>. He&nbsp;was only 14&nbsp;years old when he&nbsp;wrote one of&nbsp;his first works&nbsp;— and started thinking about his next screenplay right away. He&nbsp;never liked school, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;college. The only thing he&nbsp;liked was his history classes because those were like the movies for him. Tarantino even dropped out of&nbsp;high school to&nbsp;dedicate his time to&nbsp;his filming career and work on&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the most awarded movies of&nbsp;all time. He&nbsp;won 2&nbsp;Oscars.</p><p>Matt Damon began to&nbsp;write the script for <i>Good Will Hunting</i> while he&nbsp;was still at&nbsp;the college. In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;assignment from a&nbsp;playwriting course that helped him develop a&nbsp;rough version for that movie. He&nbsp;attended Harward University but never graduated. But, he&nbsp;did win an&nbsp;Academy Award in&nbsp;the category for Best Original Screenplay with his childhood friend Ben Affleck, who completed the project with him. Even though he&nbsp;left the college to&nbsp;pursue an&nbsp;acting career, <i>the </i>Crimson school still gave him the prestigious Harvard Arts Medal.</p><p>The opposite of&nbsp;giddy yet charming Mr. Bean, the character who made him famous all over the world, Rowan Atkinson was an&nbsp;excellent student with the best grades back at&nbsp;school. He&nbsp;has an&nbsp;extremely high<strong> IQ&nbsp;— 178. </strong>He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Newcastle University, where he&nbsp;studied engineering, and then to&nbsp;Oxford to&nbsp;master Science. He&nbsp;spent some time in&nbsp;that field, but he&nbsp;transferred to&nbsp;an&nbsp;acting career. He&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;make the audience laugh in&nbsp;movie after movie while barely speaking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/444/681/130f9850d79d1e894e37157f5a.png><p>Jodie Foster appeared on&nbsp;TV for the first time when she was only <strong>3&nbsp;years old</strong>. That’s when she learned to&nbsp;read. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;12, she already had a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the movie <i>Taxi Driver</i>. When she was&nbsp;18, she took a&nbsp;break from her acting career and enrolled at&nbsp;Yale.</p><p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt has gone through a&nbsp;transition from actor to&nbsp;actor-producer-director. But, between that, he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Columbia University to&nbsp;study French poetry, history, and literature. He&nbsp;always thought the teacher was the one that matters, not which class you were taking. After three years, he&nbsp;dropped out of&nbsp;college because he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;acting but kept a&nbsp;reputation as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the more intellectual actors in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p><strong>Eva Longoria</strong> has always been pretty independent and earned her own money from a&nbsp;young age. She worked hard because she wanted to&nbsp;help her family. And during high school, she worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant. She also has a&nbsp;master’s degree in&nbsp;Chicano Studies from Cal State Northridge University.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH54ecKeo56aop7BqrHSZquhmaRirrOxjKykmqqkmr9uwMeapWafopqutXnSnKCepqSewLW%2FjHFobXBlZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
