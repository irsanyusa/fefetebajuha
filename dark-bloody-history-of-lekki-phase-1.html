However, the eviction was brutal, displacing thousands of residents with little to no warning or support.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Available research revealed that<strong> Ligali Ayorinde, </strong>Chief Judge of Lagos State, was instrumental in forcefully evicting Maroko residents by refusing to grant a one-day extension of the 7-day radio notice. After government action, Ayorinde ruled that the subject matter had been destroyed, leaving the evictees without any legal case.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>The blood history of Lekki Phase 1</h2></p><p>On July 14th, 1990, heavily armed soldiers carried out the eviction with military precision. The terrified residents faced violence and chaos. Many women were raped and abducted.</p><p>Families were separated in the chaos. Injuries from flying debris caused death, and people drowned while running into uncovered wells. It was a war zone that caused many people to lose their homes and livelihoods.</p><p>The demolished Maroko gave rise to Lekki, a name derived from a Portuguese sailor, Mr. Lecqi, who settled in the area in the 18th and 19th centuries. Lekki's location on a naturally formed peninsula, bordering the Atlantic Ocean and Lagos Lagoon, offered prime real estate potential.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Today Lekki is a symbol of Lagos' wealth and affluence but it is strongly rooted in the tragedy of Maroko, which shows the human cost of economic growth and advancement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cLDAq6JmmpykvKXFjKGgrKyfp8Zuu8Vmo56jm556sbTArJxmaV%2BYuqa2w59r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
