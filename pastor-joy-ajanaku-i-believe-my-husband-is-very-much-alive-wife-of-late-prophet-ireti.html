He has been the one behind me. If not for Him, I would have been forgotten and everything about my husband, Prophet Elijah Ireti Ajanaku would have been forgotten. But His grace has been keeping me moving; ever since his body slept in the lord I believe he is much alive. I believe his spirit is much alive, but its only his body that slept.&nbsp; It is God that has been sustaining me. I thank God for his call over his life. If not for the fact that God called him and he is a man of God, I don’t know what would have befall his Ministry, I myself and the children and everybody he left behind. But I thank God that called him. He has been the one sustaining us.</p><p><strong>How has the growth of the church been?</strong></p><p>We thank God. The church has come out of it strong. Initially, when the whole thing happened, people thought that has the end. I don’t know what people think a man of God is. People believe a man of God is mortal body, main body when someone has to drop anytime, because death is inevitable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8sa3SraarZZqkxm6tyZqlmqOlYrZursSloJ6ulWK6unnHrqqbmZ6Zeqq%2FjK%2Bcq7FdosKktIyao6KulWLEqrLEZqafZZyWwaZ5z6umqaCVqXqqvsStoGiml5mBo4GQ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
