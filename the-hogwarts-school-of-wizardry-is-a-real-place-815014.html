Suddenly, you see a&nbsp;snowy owl outside your window. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;letter for you. Has your Hogwarts acceptance letter finally arrived? Well, not really... You open it&nbsp;and start reading;</p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>We&nbsp;are pleased to&nbsp;inform you that you have been selected by&nbsp;the Hogwarts School of&nbsp;Witchcraft and Wizardry as&nbsp;the greatest Potterhead there&nbsp;is! To&nbsp;show our gratitude for your dedication, we&nbsp;have decided to&nbsp;share 8&nbsp;wizarding world secrets with you. And don’t worry, we&nbsp;won’t “obliviate” any of&nbsp;them later...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e78/67d/05b69252ba87a4678cc1ba9e1e.png><p>Professor McGonagall was a&nbsp;Quidditch pro, too! Harry’s broom riding and Quidditch skills are recognized early on&nbsp;during his time as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hogwarts student when he&nbsp;retrieves Neville’s remembrall from Malfoy. Despite going against Madam Hooch’s instructions in&nbsp;doing that, his rebellious yet heroic act helps Professor McGonagall spot his talent. The thing&nbsp;is, she is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;because she herself has some skills of&nbsp;her own! Chris Columbus, the director of&nbsp;the first two movies, placed an&nbsp;easter egg about it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movie that is&nbsp;very easy to&nbsp;miss. When Harry starts feeling anxious and starts doubting his skills, Hermione reminds her that he&nbsp;needn’t worry because it’s in&nbsp;her blood as&nbsp;she shows him his father’s award in&nbsp;the Hogwarts trophy display. Now, if&nbsp;you take a&nbsp;closer look, you’ll see McGonagall’s smaller plaque to&nbsp;the right of&nbsp;James Potter’s.</p><p>Newt Scamander visited Hogwarts when Harry was a&nbsp;student there. Back in&nbsp;2016, “Fantastic Beast and Where to&nbsp;Find Them” introduced&nbsp;us to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the nicest and loveliest wizards, Newt Scamander. But did you know this was not really his first appearance in&nbsp;the Wizarding World movies? In&nbsp;the third movie, Fred and George Weasley gift Harry with one <a href=# title=magical data-link=tag>magical</a> GPS, aka the Marauder’s Map, that shows where every witch and wizard within Hogwarts’ limits is&nbsp;located. As&nbsp;they show him how to&nbsp;use the map, Newt Scamander’s name can actually be&nbsp;seen walking the halls of&nbsp;the school. If&nbsp;you take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;the map, you can see his name in&nbsp;the center-right area. That means, he&nbsp;was at&nbsp;Hogwarts when the “Prisoner of&nbsp;Azkaban” events were taking place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8ac/cf6/a3440a507aa6f85186f55e00c4.png><p>Another Marauder’s Map easter egg for you! The map is&nbsp;actually misspelled in&nbsp;the movie. We&nbsp;see the cover of&nbsp;the map for the first time when Fred and George hand it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Harry. And the nicknames of&nbsp;all its creators are written on&nbsp;it; Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. But careful viewers might have caught one big mistake there. The name “Moony” in&nbsp;the book is&nbsp;spelled like this [MOONY], whereas in&nbsp;the movie there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra e&nbsp;here [MOONEY]. However, apparently, that’s done by&nbsp;the filmmakers on&nbsp;purpose. They wanted to&nbsp;pay a&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;the movie’s visual effects supervisor, Karl Mooney, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;have some fun!</p><p>It&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;so&nbsp;wrong to&nbsp;say that all Potterheads have at&nbsp;least once fantasized about how awesome it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;flying on&nbsp;Buckbeak like Harry did in&nbsp;“Prisoners of&nbsp;Azkaban.” One detail about the majestic hippogriff you might have missed in&nbsp;the movie is&nbsp;that right before meeting the students, Buckbeak actually “relieves himself...” Since no&nbsp;real hippogriffs were used during filming and Buckbeak was all CGI, this was obviously a&nbsp;choice made by&nbsp;the creative team. It’s safe to&nbsp;assume they did it&nbsp;to&nbsp;make the mythological creature seem more realistic, but that doesn’t change the fact that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hilarious!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e8b/818/bf63a6538a8de9ad88b2130017.png><p>Dial this number, and maybe you can access the Ministry of&nbsp;Magic, too! Mr. Weasley has always been fascinated by&nbsp;the creativity of&nbsp;Muggles. As&nbsp;Harry navigates him through the normal side of&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> in&nbsp;“<a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> and the Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix,” he&nbsp;marvels at&nbsp;all the different inventions, such as&nbsp;bicycles and public transport. But when it’s time to&nbsp;head to&nbsp;the magical side, it’s Mr. Weasley who guides Harry this time. Once they are in&nbsp;one particular red telephone booth, Mr. Weasley puts some money and dials 6, 2, 4, 4, 2. And it&nbsp;turns out this is&nbsp;how visitors enter the Ministry of&nbsp;Magic. And these numbers are not chosen randomly. They actually spell out the word magic on&nbsp;a&nbsp;telephone’s number pad.</p><p>With “Fantastic Beasts” we&nbsp;were introduced to&nbsp;new fascinating and adorable Wizarding World creatures. And one thing’s for sure, Newt Scamander treats each and every one of&nbsp;them with love and respect, unlike the dragon handlers in&nbsp;“Harry Potter and the Goblet of&nbsp;Fire.” However, the director, Mike Newell, left a&nbsp;little message to&nbsp;assure the fans that all the magical creatures were actually treated right. If&nbsp;you wait until the end of&nbsp;the credits, you’ll see&nbsp;it: “no&nbsp;dragons were harmed in&nbsp;the making of&nbsp;this movie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/99a/bc5/e664875235addae59601e8bce7.png><p>There are plenty of&nbsp;“number&nbsp;7” references throughout the movies. In&nbsp;the series, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;established that the number seven is&nbsp;a&nbsp;magical number that holds great power, and one of&nbsp;the biggest uses of&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;Voldermort’s seven Horcruxes. When talking to&nbsp;Slughorn in&nbsp;“Half-Blood Prince,” Tom Riddle questions if&nbsp;having seven Horcruxes instead of&nbsp;one will make one more powerful. However, that’s not the only sign that foreshadows what comes next. When we&nbsp;see Tom Riddle’s childhood bedroom, there are seven rocks on&nbsp;the windowsill, which also indicates what’s to&nbsp;come. One thing to&nbsp;mention here though, after the series ended J.K. Rowling released information about an&nbsp;eighth Horcrux. Since Professor Quirrell temporarily contained part of&nbsp;Voldemort’s soul, he&nbsp;acted as&nbsp;a&nbsp;temporary Horcrux. Here are some other appearances of&nbsp;number 7&nbsp;throughout the series that you might have missed;</p><p>There are seven Weasley siblings. There are seven core magical classes. The prophecy stated that the hero who would take down the Dark Lord would be&nbsp;born “as&nbsp;the seventh month dies.” In&nbsp;“Deathly Hallows,” when the Order is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;take Harry from the Privet Drive safely, their escape plan includes seven different Harrys. There are seven different obstacles guarding the sorcerer’s stone in&nbsp;the book. Hogwarts castle consists of&nbsp;seven floors. Seven is&nbsp;the age by&nbsp;which magic will show itself if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;present. Seven muggles saw Harry and Ron flying in&nbsp;the car. The basilisk attacked seven entities, including Harry, during the events of&nbsp;“Chamber of&nbsp;Secrets.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/562/ec2/02c3c15f809a04064b2509b23e.png><p>In&nbsp;“Goblet of&nbsp;Fire,” there are seven keyholes on&nbsp;Professor Moody’s trunk. In&nbsp;“Order of&nbsp;the Phoenix,” during Harry’s trial for using magic outside of&nbsp;school, he&nbsp;was found innocent thanks to&nbsp;the Clause Seven, which stated that magic could be&nbsp;used before muggles in&nbsp;life-threatening situations. How many of&nbsp;them were you able to&nbsp;spot before?</p><p>Hogwarts is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real place! Well... Kind of... You must have heard about the Harry Potter Studio Tour and maybe even got a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;experience&nbsp;it. But several movie scenes were actually shot at&nbsp;real-life locations. Here are a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;them you might want to&nbsp;visit next time you are in&nbsp;the UK; Remember the first time Harry realized that he&nbsp;can understand snakes? The scene was shot inside London Zoo’s Reptile House. So, you can head there to&nbsp;test your parseltongue skills. In&nbsp;the books, Hogwarts is&nbsp;set in&nbsp;the Scottish Highlands, and many of&nbsp;the movies’ exterior shots were filmed in&nbsp;Scotland as&nbsp;well. Loch Shiel was one of&nbsp;those places, and it&nbsp;was used as&nbsp;the location for Black Lake. But we&nbsp;don’t suggest that you go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;swim in&nbsp;it&nbsp;like Harry did in&nbsp;“Goblet of&nbsp;Fire.” There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;merpeople bothering you, but there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;hypothermia since Scottish lochs can be&nbsp;freezing cold even in&nbsp;summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/324/e89/459d645a9dbb4f1d7df453d8d8.png><p>In&nbsp;“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” Yorkshire county’s Goathland Station was used as&nbsp;the film location for Hogsmeade Station where the students depart from Hogwarts at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the movie. Another Yorkshire one here! Malham Cove, the large curved limestone formation, which definitely has an&nbsp;otherworldly look to&nbsp;it, was one of&nbsp;the sites where Harry and Hermione were camping in&nbsp;part one of&nbsp;“Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows.” Well, that is&nbsp;all. Now that you’ve finished reading your letter, we’d appreciate it&nbsp;if&nbsp;you can send&nbsp;us a&nbsp;Muggle chocolate bar or&nbsp;two back with our owl. Because our frogs keep jumping away...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYyhpqCvkafBtHnSnJ%2Bop5xivKd51qKxmqqUp8ZutdJmmGaqlZa5brzLmpqeZWhmgnF9k2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
