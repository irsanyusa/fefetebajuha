These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Here’s an idea, how about we give some actual living human comedians a listen to?” Carlin continued. “But if you want to listen to the genuine George Carlin, he has 14 specials that you can find anywhere.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>My statement regarding the AI generated George Carlin special: My dad spent a lifetime perfecting his craft from his very human life, brain and imagination. &nbsp;No machine will ever replace his genius. These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind…1/3</p>— Kelly Carlin (@kelly_carlin) <a href=#>January 11, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The special addresses current topics Carlin may have broached in his comedy if he were alive, including mass shootings and billionaires like Jeff Bezos and <a href=#>Elon Musk</a>. “I just want to let you know very clearly that what you’re about to hear is not George Carlin. It’s my impersonation of George Carlin that I developed in the exact same way a human impressionist would,” the AI says at the beginning of the special. “I listened to all of George Carlin’s material and did my best to imitate his voice, cadence and attitude as well as the subject matter I think would have interested him today. So think of it like Andy Kaufman impersonating Elvis or like Will Ferrell impersonating George W. Bush.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The show is the second Dudesy comedy special. The first, an AI-generated standup routine featuring the likeness of former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, was removed after Brady threatened legal action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWVpgXiFjqCcqKqXmnqkrdGloKdlkZ56pLvMnpuyZaOlsqS1wKVknKeeqb%2BwwsSrqrJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
