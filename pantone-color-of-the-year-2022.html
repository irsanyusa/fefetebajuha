Like <a href=# rel=noopener>last year’s selection of two colors, Ultimate Gray and the sunny yellow Illuminating</a>, the choice of Very Peri was largely influenced by the desire to overcome the <a href=# rel=noopener>COVID-19 pandemic</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>environmental concerns</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>a larger reckoning with injustice</a> and flaws within our current social structures.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To capture these influences, the institute blended blue (a color associated with faithfulness and constancy) with a hint of red (which often conveys energy and excitement) for an unexpectedly warm blue hue that communicates innovation and a fresh start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COY22-flatlay-fashion.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s unusual to refer to blue as ‘happy,’ but when you add that red element to it, that’s exactly what happened,” says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the institute. “We felt it was so important to put together a color that encapsulated the feeling of newness.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The concept of newness also speaks to the increasing influence of the virtual world, with the emergence of the <a href=#>Metaverse</a>, recreational trends like VR gaming and <a href=#>esports</a> and the growing popularity of cryptocurrency and <a href=#>NFTs</a>. And since blue light is the element most often associated with technology and futurism in the visual culture of science fiction, not to mention our daily interactions with smartphones and computers, it comes as no surprise that Very Peri was selected to represent a time when our real and online lives are so prominently converging.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Most Popular from TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Understanding that the colors we see are now living in the digital space opened up a whole other gamut of possibilities for us,” says Laurie Pressman, vice president of the institute. “When we select the Pantone color of the year, it must be emblematic of what’s taking place at a moment in time. We were looking at a color that seamlessly moves between digital and physical.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/COY22-flatlay-graphics-pkg.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ultimately, this new shade—and even the act of creating it—is meant to represent what many are hoping for in 2022: a fresh start for a world that knows that old systems and habits can no longer stand up to the challenges of today, let alone the days to come.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We’re entering this different time where we’re reimagining our future, trying to rewrite our lives and acknowledging all the unknown before us,” Pressman says. “Looking at the world with different eyes has brought us—and will continue to bring us—new solutions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWJrgXd%2FjqmYp6yfo7Jur86lpqtln5t6tbTEZrCemaJif3F%2BkWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
