The actress is set to make her directorial debut with film titled Color Your Hurt — a true story of a young gay man who grew up in the bible belt.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bella-thorne-to-make-directing-debut-with-color-your-hurt>Bella Thorne to Make Directing Debut with Color Your Hurt</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actress</a> has kicked off the making of Color Your Hurt, with the casting process already underway. Meanwhile, the filming is currently lining up for the Midwest and Italy in spring of 2024.</p><p>The project is based on Thorne’s original screenplay and a short film she created titled Unsettled. She made the same in June 2023 with producers Jen Gatien and Eddie Alcazar. It was then edited by Ron Dulin, with additional editing from Affonso Goncalves. She did this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">project</a> around the time she debuted her short film Paint Her Red at the Taormina Film Festival.</p><p>Color Your Hurt will be produced by Gatien alongside David Lipper and Robert A. Daly Jr., Dani Duz, and Mark Emms. On the other hand, Adam Sigal and CG Lewis will serve as the project’s executive producers.</p><p>It’s not the first time that the Game of Love star worked with some of Color Your Hurt’s producers. She previously worked with Sigal, Druz, and Lipper on The Tower, which is now in post-production.</p><p>Thorne has also previously worked with Gatien on Midnight Sun. Lastly, she had a professional link with Alcazar with 2023 film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Divinity</a>.</p><p>“Bella is remarkably talented, and Bob Daly and I want to support her vision in what is a very important story that needs to be told,” Lipper said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-said-the-film-marks-an-exhilarating-chapter-of-her-career>She Said the Film Marks an “Exhilarating” Chapter of Her Career</h2><p>On Instagram, the actress reflected on the recent achievement. Getting candid about her feelings, Thorne said she’s “beyond excited and grateful” to team up with the cast of the film. Later, Thorne revealed she’s “more than honored to tell this incredible true story.”</p><p>“Color Your Hurt is not just a screenplay; it’s one of the most inspiring projects I’ve ever penned. As I step into my new role as a movie director, it symbolizes the beginning of a truly impactful and exhilarating chapter in my career. I could not be more honored to tell a true story that has moments I deeply connect with,” Thorne said.</p><p>Recently, several of her fans assumed that she will be having a cameo role in season three of The White Lotus. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thorne</a> wasn’t really one to spill the tea. Amid her interview with The Messenger, she said that she can’t really give much details about it.</p><p>“I can’t say anything. There’s not a word from my mouth,” she said. “But I will say I love [creator] Mike White. He is amazing. I am a huge Mike White supporter, and I will leave it at that.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_SelenaGomez_BennyBlanco_Allen-Berezovsky_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Selena Gomez, Benny Blanco Wrap Up The 2024 Golden Globes with a Hot Kiss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bella thorne</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6jpZldqbWwvs2eZK2nXaKurLGMnaCrnZOptq%2BzjJ2cm62kYq6ju9StZJpll5bGbrnAp2Sipl2ptaZ5waKZpZ1dl7KtwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
