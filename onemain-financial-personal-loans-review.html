Of course, banks and credit unions offer personal loans, though the amounts are small and designed for borrowers with good or excellent credit.</p><p>This is where online personal loan lenders can help. One example is <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a>. It doesn’t offer the lowest personal loan rates, but you’ll have an excellent chance of approval even <a rel=alternate href=#>if you have poor credit</a>.</p><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> is one of the better-established personal loan companies. It’s a publicly traded company (NYSE: OMF) based in Evansville, Ind., and has been in business for over 100 years.</p><p>It has a <a rel=nofollow href=#>Better Business Bureau rating</a> of B (on a scale of A+ to F) and a <a rel=nofollow href=#>Trustpilot rating</a> of 4.8 out of five stars from more than 56,000 reviews. And <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> scores well with high ratings from mobile app users on both <a rel=nofollow href=#>Google Play</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>the App Store</a>.</p><h3 class=product-title>OneMain Financial</h3><p>APR</p><p>18% to 35.99%</p><p>Loan amount</p><p>$1,500 to $20,000</p><p>Term</p><p>34 to 60 months</p><p>Min. credit score</p><p>Undisclosed</p><h2 id=who-is-onemain-best-for>Who is OneMain best for?</h2><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a>’s maximum loan amount is lower than its competitors, so it’s a good option for those who need smaller loan amounts. You can use a <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> loan for any purpose, including <a rel=alternate href=#>debt consolidation</a>, medical expenses, vacations, vehicle purchases, etc.</p><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> also offers a network of branch locations, which is unusual for a personal loan provider. With offices in 44 states nationwide, it’s the perfect choice if you would rather apply for a loan in person than online.</p><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> can also be a good choice if you have poor credit. The company permits co-borrowers if you need help to qualify. Alternatively, it will accept collateral, such as a motor vehicle, as security for the loan.</p><h2 id=onemain-at-a-glance>OneMain at a glance</h2><h3>Costs</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> does charge a loan origination fee. Depending on the lender and the loan, it can be between $25 and $500 or between 1% and 10% of the loan amount. The origination fee is deducted from the personal loan amount, reducing the net proceeds you will receive.</p><p>There are also late payment fees to consider. These can be either a flat amount between $5 and $30 or between 1.5% and 15% of the amount of the payment missed. Exactly which fee structure you will be subject to is based on your state of residence.</p><p>Finally, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> charges an insufficient funds fee. It varies between $10 and $50 per returned payment, based on your state of residence.</p><p>One advantage on the cost side is that there is no prepayment penalty for paying off your loan early with <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a>.</p><h3>Perks</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> offers the following perks to borrowers:</p><ul><li>Change your due date – You’ll have the ability to change your payment due date. You can request one change in a 12-month period and no more than two changes over the life of the loan. The maximum payment extension is 15 days, but it will not be granted if your account is 10 or more days past due.</li><li>Enroll in Direct Pay – If you prefer to automate your monthly payment, you can sign up for this service free of charge.</li><li>Protection under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) – The act provides active duty members of the U.S. military with interest rate caps and protection from repossession, foreclosure, judgments, and evictions.</li></ul><h3>Loan amounts</h3><p>Loans are available in amounts ranging from $1,000 to $20,000, though certain states impose minimum and maximum limits on personal loan amounts. For example, the minimum loan in California is $3,000. The maximum loan in North Carolina is $9,000.</p><h3>Loan terms</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> offers loan terms of 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.</p><h2 id=onemain-personal-loans-pros-and-cons>OneMain personal loans: Pros and cons</h2><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>No minimum credit score</li><li>Brick-and-mortar branches</li><li>Shop multiple loan offers</li><li>Fast funding</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Low maximum loan amount</li><li>High origination fee</li><li>Borrower qualifications are vague</li><li>Not available in all states</li></ul><h2 id=benefits-of-onemain-personal-loans>Benefits of OneMain personal loans</h2><h3>No minimum credit score</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> does not publish a minimum credit score requirement. The company accepts all types of credit, with options to add a co-borrower or a collateral arrangement to provide additional security for the loan.</p><h3>Brick-and-mortar branches</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> has physical branches located in all states where it operates. The company claims 89% of Americans live within 25 miles of one of its branches. This can be a big advantage for borrowers who prefer to deal in person when applying for a loan rather than doing it online by themselves.</p><h3>Shop multiple loan offers</h3><p>When you apply with <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a>, you may receive offers from multiple lenders. This will give you an opportunity to choose the loan that will work best for you.</p><h3>Fast funding</h3><p>Once your loan application has been approved and you have signed the required loan documents, you will receive your funds within a day or two. If you choose to receive the funds via SpeedFunds, they will be deposited into your bank account on the loan closing date.</p><p>You can also choose to receive a check immediately at the <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> branch where the loan is closed. If funding occurs via ACH, your money will be available in one or two business days.</p><h2 id=drawbacks-of-onemain-personal-loans>Drawbacks of OneMain personal loans</h2><h3>Low maximum loan amount</h3><p>While most personal loan lenders provide maximum loans of $35,000 or $50,000, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> offers a maximum of $20,000, which may not be sufficient for all borrowers.</p><h3>High origination fees</h3><p>Origination fees among personal loan lenders are common, but <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a>’s maximum origination fee of 10% is at the upper end of the industry range.</p><h3>Borrower qualifications are vague</h3><p>Not only does <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> not indicate a minimum credit score requirement, but it also doesn’t provide a specific minimum income amount.</p><p>Instead, the company indicates that applicants must demonstrate sufficient income to cover current living expenses and debt payments in addition to the new loan payment.</p><h3>Not available in all states</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> offers its loan products in 44 states. It doesn’t operate in Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, or Vermont. Washington, D.C., is also not listed as a location where the company does business.</p><h2 id=how-does-onemain-stack-up-with-the-competition>How does OneMain stack up with the competition?</h2><p>The table below shows how <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> compares with major competitors based on loan details and minimum credit requirements.</p><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1egiqiw-1 iyftyt not-prose"><tr class=table-row></tr><tbody><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>18% to 35.99%</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>7.8% to 35.99%</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>8.49% to 35.99%</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>9.95% to 35.99%</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>$1,500 to $20,000</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>$1,000 to $50,000</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>$1,000 to $50,000</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>$2,000 to $35,000</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Undisclosed</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>34 to 60 months</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>36, 60 or 84 months</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>24 to 84 months</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>12 to 60 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=how-to-qualify-for-onemain>How to qualify for OneMain</h2><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>OneMain Financial</a> does not provide specific guidelines on loan qualifications, such as a minimum credit score or income level. However, if you cannot qualify for a loan based on your own income and credit profile, you can add a qualified co-borrower.</p><p>You can also be considered for loan approval if you can provide collateral.
