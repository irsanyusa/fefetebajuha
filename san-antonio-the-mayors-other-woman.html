So high had his star risen during four much admired terms in office that in 1984 Cisneros was considered a potential Democratic vice-presidential candidate. But last week the mayor, 41, took a dive off his pedestal into the sort of public mess that swallowed up Gary Hart. Cisneros confessed, in an off-the-record interview with columnist Paul Thompson, published by the San Antonio Express-News, that he has been entangled in a two-year love affair with a 39-year-old married campaign worker, Linda Medlar. Said Medlar, wife of a local jeweler, in the same article: “He’s the love of my life . . . We hope to be able to live out the rest of our lives together.” The mayor had admitted unspecified marital “difficulties” in his 19-year marriage to high school sweetheart Mary Alice. They have three children, including a son born last year with a heart defect. The stunning disclosure came after months of rumors about his extramarital love life and only a month after Cisneros declared he would not seek a fifth term. As observers were quick to point out, in a constituency with a Roman Catholic and Hispanic majority, his revelations about Linda, an Anglo, could make his retirement permanent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9uamtla4Nwv8CnZJqmpKS7qruMrZ%2BeZZ2WxrC%2B0mamraCVp3q4u8yapWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
