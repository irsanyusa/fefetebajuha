Just a couple of seconds into performing “Rude Boy” by Rihanna Pagny turned her chair directly followed by both Mika and Pascal Obispo’s chair turns.</strong></p><p>The three judges were dancing and enjoying Dury’s amazing performance where she owned the stage, but she started gaining more of their attention when she began singing a part of the song in Spanish.&nbsp;Not only can she sing, but she also could dance and perform on the stage really well. Her ability to sing in multiple languages also made her a triple threat. In the end, she went with Mika as her coach.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-unexpected-bilingual-version-of-rude-boy-on-the-voice>Unexpected Bilingual Version of “Rude Boy” on ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Dury, who is of Colombian descent, continued pretty strongly in the competition. The 22-year-old said, “<span class=goog-text-highlight>I want people to feel good and want to dance,” which she definitely did starting with her audition. Unfortunately, her multiple talents were not enough to keep the 22-year-old in the competition as she was eliminated following anothe bilingual performance. Her talent lives on as the blind audition video has 25 million views on YouTube and her final performance has 282,000 views.</span></p><p>Even though the coaches really enjoyed Dury’s voice, she did get a lot of backlash over her singing from viewers who felt she wasn’t that strong of a singer outside of her moments rapping in Spanish. A lot of viewers didn’t understand how she also got a chair turn after a couple of seconds into her audition.&nbsp;</p><p>One viewer commented “She has the looks, the sas, but not the vocals. The Spanish rap was good but not the English singing. If she had singing lessons I’m sure she’d be amazing.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>RIHANNA ACCUSED Of STEALING IDEAS FOR HER SAVAGE X FENTY FASHION SHOW</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-drea-now>Where is Drea Now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>WATCH ANGRY GIRL GROUP INSULT ‘RUDE’ SIMON COWELL AS YOU’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE</a></p><p>The Colombian singer, who has been passionate about having a music career since the age of 15, did not let the negative comments from viewers and her quick elimination on the famous show stop her from continuing her passion of becoming a singer. Dury currently has 29,000 Instagram followers and 16,000 YouTube subscribers.</p><p>So far, she only has one music video called “Thank God” Ft Modrick that was released three years ago and has 291,000 views. Dury seems to have also caught the attention of award-winning singer and music producer will.i.am as they currently have a song together called “Brutal” that was released in March of last year. In the video, she can be seen rapping and singing the whole time in Spanish. We’re sure she’ll continue to develop her skills with each additional collab.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Billy-Gilman-The-Voice.png alt="Child Country Star All Grown Up Performs an Adele Classic On ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blind auditions</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice france</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571pqrnKBdmb%2BmrYydrKuxo2LCr7HXqZycrJWZeqO1y6KloK2RoXq3sdGsoKimXaSzbr7UnZxmmp%2BuerC6jK2fnmWmpLaksYyfqZqmk5p8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
