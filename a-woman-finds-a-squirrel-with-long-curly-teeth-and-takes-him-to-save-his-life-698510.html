The animal looked too skinny and had a&nbsp;small chance of&nbsp;surviving much longer so&nbsp;Jannet decided to&nbsp;help him.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side, </strong>we<strong>&nbsp;</strong>love animals so&nbsp;much and we’re excited to&nbsp;share another story about an&nbsp;unusual animal and his happy ending. Don’t miss our bonus at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article&nbsp;— it&nbsp;will show you how cute squirrels can&nbsp;be.</p><p>While doing some work around her yard this past summer, <a href=#>Jannet Talbott</a> noticed a&nbsp;little squirrel struggling to&nbsp;eat some food from the bird feeder. The squirrel had something sticking out of&nbsp;his mouth.</p><p>After taking a&nbsp;closer look, Jannet saw that those were overgrown teeth curling backward and preventing the squirrel from eating normally. Basically, squirrels’ teeth should get ground down by&nbsp;nuts and tree bark but it&nbsp;didn’t happen in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;this animal. The poor guy obviously needed some help and Jannet decided to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;hand.</p><p>She took the squirrel home and called him Bucky. The woman found out that an&nbsp;incorrect bite was causing the incisors to&nbsp;grow long. She then learned how to&nbsp;trim a&nbsp;squirrel’s teeth by&nbsp;watching various tutorials on&nbsp;Youtube.</p><p>Jannet took a&nbsp;standard cuticle trimmer and trimmed the squirrel’s incisors. Bucky stayed calm during the procedure, perhaps feeling that whatever was happening was happening for good.</p><p>After everything had been done, Jannet released Bucky and was glad to&nbsp;see that he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;eat whole peanuts. She was also happy to&nbsp;see the squirrel sharpening his incisors on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree&nbsp;— just the way it&nbsp;should&nbsp;be.</p><p><h2>Bonus: These pics don’t have Jannet in&nbsp;them but we&nbsp;thought they were worth posting just to&nbsp;show you how cute squirrels can&nbsp;be.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b31/906/fddb3f5a7da9279f1c6ed3ce97.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/914/754/ffbd2852e48f63cf2400cf222a.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0a/cab/30a1cd59c4bb56ff2fffe74aae.jpg><p>Did you like the story?
