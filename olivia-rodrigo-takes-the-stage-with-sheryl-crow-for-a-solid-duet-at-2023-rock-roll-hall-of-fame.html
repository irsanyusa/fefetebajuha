The “Déjà Vu” singer joined Crow for a duet at the 2023 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-olivia-rodrigo-sings-if-it-makes-you-happy-with-sheryl-crow>Olivia Rodrigo Sings “If It Makes You Happy” with Sheryl Crow</h2><p>Singing Crow’s 1996 hit song “If It Makes You Happy,” the duo gave the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</a> ceremony crowd a wonderful show. Olivia and Rodrigo were clearly comfortable with each other, both smiling as they took the stage.</p><p>In an interview with Billboard after the performance, Rodrigo said it was an “honor” to join the Crow on stage. She added that she’s “excited” for her induction into the famous hall.</p><p>“I am a massive fan of hers and her incredible songwriting. She’s equally as kind as she is talented and I feel so lucky that I was able to be part of celebrating such a legend,” she said.</p><p>The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony wasn’t the first time that Crow and Rodrigo belted out the song together. In September, the pair performed “If It Makes You Happy” at the Bluebird Café in Nashville.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Luckily, Rodrigo’s admiration for the singer was reciprocated. During her guest appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Crow praised Rodrigo’s character.</p><p>“She’s a great songwriter. She seems kinda unaffected by all of it, you know? When I was 19, her age, I was like, ‘How do you fill out this application for college?!'” she said.</p><p>According to the “All I Wanna Do” singer, she met Rodrigo in 2022 when they were working on a “whole bunch of Grammy stuff.”</p><p>“We wound up on some stuff together and she’s super cool,” she said. “She asked me to do this thing when she came to Nashville, and so I was like, ‘OK!’ So I texted her and said, ‘Hey, would you do the Rock Hall with me?’ She was like, ‘I would love to. I’d be so honored.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-crow-gives-olivia-her-advice-on-fame>Crow Gives Olivia Her Advice on Fame</h2><p>During the special evening, Crow reiterated her support for Rodrigo. In an interview with ET, the “Strong Enough” singer expressed her awe for the young artist.</p><p>“I mean, you know, I got to sort of lift her up a little bit, because she’s got a new record [out]… I know how hard the second record is, the sophomore. You’re competing with the success of your first record, and she nailed it,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, as a concerned idol, she also gave a piece of advice to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rodrigo</a>. According to Crow, she emphasized the significance of writing at least once a day.</p><p>“I said, you know, ‘If you can, just write down one sentence every day, of what happened during that day, because you will someday look back [at] this, and try to remember all the things.'”</p><p>“The other thing is to just stay in the work and stay out of the chatter,” she said. “That’s a major thing.”</p><p>The “Drivers License” singer appeared in a video montage about Crow’s career during the induction ceremony.</p><p>“Nobody could say that besides Sheryl. She says things I would have never thought of in the most beautiful way,” she said. The love is mutual, with Crow naming Rodrigo “the real deal” on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the night before.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_TaylorLautner_TayLautner_Weiss-Eubanks_NBCUniversal-220x147.jpg alt="How Taylor Lautner Met His Wife, Tay Lautner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>olivia rodrigo</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Sheryl Crow</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zqWgr6GRYr%2BwsNGinqhlpJa4pr%2BMrZ%2BeZaOprqixjLCgraBdqLWmvtilZJyqn6x6p7vRZphmq5%2BhtqV5w66crWWRqXpzfJFsZKunk6B6s7vLpWShmZyherCyjJ%2BYpp1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
