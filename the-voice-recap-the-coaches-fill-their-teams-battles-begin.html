John Legend was the first coach to turn his chair, followed by Camila Cabello, Gwen Stefani, and Blake Shelton.</p><p>Kim previously went viral for her singing and performed background vocals for Monica. Legend told her that she should be in the finale this season. Although all four coaches wanted Kim on their teams, she chose to join Team Legend. As Shelton complained, “John is getting all the four-chair turns, and I’m sick of it.”</p><p>Later in the episode, Justin Aaron joined Gwen Stefani’s team after singing Legend’s song “Glory.” Similarly, Nia Skyfer joined Team Legend after singing Cabello’s song “Bam Bam.” Cabello had already filled her team, but said she wants to steal Nia later if she has the chance.</p><p>Another notable moment during Monday’s show came after Jaeden Luke auditioned with Bread’s “Make It With You.” He flirted with Cabello, telling her, “I might have been singing it for you.” Cabello said he was “making my whole day.” However, her team was full, so Jaeden ended up choosing to join Team Blake.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHY DO ‘THE VOICE’ COACHES WEAR THE SAME CLOTHES IN EVERY EPISODE?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-battles-begin-with-a-team-blake-match-up>The Battles Begin with a Team Blake Match-Up</h3><p>Once all the coaches had filled up their teams during Monday’s show, the Battles began. This was exciting, partly because we finally get to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">see them in different outfits</a>. It also means that we’ll get to see the coaches <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcome their Battle Advisors</a>.</p><p>This episode only featured one Battle, on Blake Shelton’s team. Austin Montgomery and Tanner Fussell performed “Folsom Prison Blues” by Johnny Cash, mentored by Shelton and Battle Advisor Jimmie Allen, who shared that he had auditioned for The Voice in the past and been rejected.</p><p>Cabello called Austin and Tanner’s Battle “an award show performance.” Stefani said she was “blown away.” Shelton clearly had a hard time choosing between them. Unfortunately, we have to wait until Tuesday night’s show to find out what he decided, and if we’ll see a save or a steal for the losing artist.</p><p>The Voice Season 22 Battles will continue on Tuesday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_CharliePuth_Michael-HickeyGetty-Images.jpg alt="Charlie Puth Claims He was Abandoned by Ellen DeGeneres’s Record Label" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXam1pnnCqJicoJWoeqe1y6VkraCVnr9uwMSapKxlkpbBtbjErGSbnZeeu3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
