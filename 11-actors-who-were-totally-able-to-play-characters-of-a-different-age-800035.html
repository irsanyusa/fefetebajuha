This also tends to&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;<a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> based on&nbsp;novels or&nbsp;books, where certain roles have aspects that require actors with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;experience to&nbsp;play them.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we&nbsp;compared photos of&nbsp;some actors who had to&nbsp;play people who were a&nbsp;different age than they were, with images of&nbsp;how they looked when they were that actual age.</p><p><h2>1. Andrew Garfield as&nbsp;Peter Parker in&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6b/559/6f8c715fae964501a299403a1d.jpg><p><a href=#>Andrew Garfield</a> played Peter Parker (a&nbsp;17-year-old) twice. However, in&nbsp;the first film that was <a href=#>shot</a> in&nbsp;2010, Andrew was 27&nbsp;years old and had to&nbsp;put himself in&nbsp;the shoes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young <a href=# title=Spider-Man data-link=tag>Spider-Man</a> who was 10&nbsp;years younger than him. In&nbsp;the second image, we&nbsp;can see how the actor looked in&nbsp;his first appearance in&nbsp;the 2005 series <a href=#>Sugar Rush</a>, with a&nbsp;more youthful appearance at&nbsp;22.</p><p><h2>2. Jennifer Lawrence as&nbsp;Joy Mangano in&nbsp;Joy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6da/cf3/3adb2e51608457dc856f655647.jpg><p><a href=#>Jennifer</a>, besides being a&nbsp;great actress, can play all kinds of&nbsp;roles, as&nbsp;she demonstrated in&nbsp;the movie <a href=#>Joy</a>, by&nbsp;bringing Joy Mangano to&nbsp;life. At&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the film, she was 25&nbsp;years old and put herself in&nbsp;the shoes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;30-year-old single mother with 2&nbsp;children in&nbsp;her care, who decided to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;invention to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;millionaire. And Jennifer remains radiant at&nbsp;30, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;can see in&nbsp;the second image.</p><p><h2>3. Audrey Hepburn as&nbsp;Holly Golightly in&nbsp;Breakfast at&nbsp;Tiffany’s</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/253/422/9dadb35bdf89daef2db72f16a9.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most remembered roles in&nbsp;Audrey’s career was that of&nbsp;young Holly Golightly in&nbsp;<a href=#>Breakfast at&nbsp;Tiffany’s</a>. The novel on&nbsp;which this film is&nbsp;based tells&nbsp;us about the experiences of&nbsp;an&nbsp;intelligent 19-year-old girl. However, in&nbsp;1960, when the shooting of&nbsp;the film began, <a href=#>Audrey</a> was 31&nbsp;years old. In&nbsp;the second picture, we&nbsp;can see her looking younger when she was actually 19&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>4. Alan Rickman as&nbsp;Severus Snape in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Chamber of&nbsp;Secrets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4b/2fa/807c2e54709bae78bc14e2fdb5.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most feared and remembered characters from the magical <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> saga is&nbsp;Professor Snape. In&nbsp;the film <a href=#>Harry Potter and the Chamber of&nbsp;Secrets</a>, the plot takes place in&nbsp;the ’90s, when Severus was teaching at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;32. However, <a href=#>Alan Rickman</a> managed to&nbsp;bring this character to&nbsp;life at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;55. In&nbsp;the second image, which belongs to&nbsp;the television series <a href=#>Romeo &&nbsp;Juliet</a>, we&nbsp;can see Alan at&nbsp;32&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>5. Ian Somerhalder as&nbsp;Damon Salvatore in&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa0/fbd/ed87f25eb18e55843077f974bc.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this series for teenagers that is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;paranormal events and with a&nbsp;dark atmosphere, we&nbsp;put ourselves in&nbsp;the situation of&nbsp;the young protagonist (who falls in&nbsp;love with 2&nbsp;vampire brothers). The one with the worst intentions was played by&nbsp;actor <a href=#>Ian Somerhalder,</a> who was 30&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the shooting. However, Damon’s character was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>seen</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young man between the ages of&nbsp;20&nbsp;and 21. In&nbsp;the second picture we&nbsp;can see how the actor actually looked at&nbsp;21&nbsp;in&nbsp;the series <a href=#>Young Americans</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Florence Pugh as&nbsp;Amy March in&nbsp;Little Women</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/42b/07e/d3abb95e59bbfe54fdd77bb5ad.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;the film Little Women, actress <a href=#>Florence Pugh</a> brought Amy March, the 12-year-old younger sister with a&nbsp;talent for painting, to&nbsp;life. However, she was 23&nbsp;years old when the film was shot, and she had to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;<a href=#>character</a> 11&nbsp;years younger.</p><p><h2>7. Leonardo DiCaprio as&nbsp;Frank Abagnale&nbsp;Jr. in&nbsp;Catch Me&nbsp;If&nbsp;You Can</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a03/b6b/158b05584c832eb6160da5a265.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this popular film, we&nbsp;are shown the ingenuity and cunning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>young</a> man who has just turned 19&nbsp;and who, after pretending to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;pilot, a&nbsp;doctor, and a&nbsp;lawyer, makes an&nbsp;immense fortune. <a href=#>Leonardo</a> was chosen to&nbsp;give life to&nbsp;this iconic and charismatic personality in&nbsp;2002 when he&nbsp;was 28&nbsp;years old. With a&nbsp;physique more typical of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, in&nbsp;the second image, we&nbsp;can see how Leo looked at&nbsp;age 19&nbsp;when he&nbsp;played Tobias Wolff in&nbsp;This Boy’s Life.</p><p><h2>8. Emilia Clarke as&nbsp;Daenerys Targaryen in&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/2bc/450/839f81534b99ce7b476ebee638.jpeg><p>Game of&nbsp;Thrones, the world-renowned <a href=#>series</a>, showed&nbsp;us a&nbsp;whole variety of&nbsp;characters that were hard to&nbsp;forget. Daenerys, besides being the main character, was one of&nbsp;those that evolved the most throughout the production. The actress who gave life to&nbsp;this character was <a href=#>Emilia Clarke</a>, who at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;24&nbsp;played 17-year-old Daenerys.</p><p><h2>9. Alexis Bledel as&nbsp;Rory Gilmore in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68e/dc5/bb26e557c8aae66ebe1799d184.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this&nbsp;TV <a href=#>series</a>, we&nbsp;learned about the busy and intense experiences of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother who had her daughter, Rory, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager. The role of&nbsp;the almost 16-year-old intellectual girl was played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Alexis</a> in&nbsp;2000, when she was 19&nbsp;years old. In&nbsp;the second image, we&nbsp;can see what Alexis looked like at&nbsp;16.</p><p><h2>10. Leighton Meester as&nbsp;Blair Waldorf in&nbsp;Gossip Girl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e2/896/c8bf76591b90d175677ca9c5ce.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most remembered characters in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV <a href=#>series</a> was the beautiful and popular Blair Waldorf, who was in&nbsp;high school at&nbsp;age 16. <a href=#>Leighton</a> brought this girl to&nbsp;life when she was 21&nbsp;years old in&nbsp;2007. In&nbsp;the second image, from the film <a href=#>Hangman’s Curse</a>, we&nbsp;can see what Meester looked like at&nbsp;age&nbsp;16.</p><p><h2>11. Jennifer Lawrence as&nbsp;Katniss Everdeen in&nbsp;The Hunger Games</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/863/62b/086ecd5827bcd6eb12f194c0ae.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2011, it&nbsp;was announced that the main character of&nbsp;the film <a href=#>The Hunger Games</a> would be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;Jennifer. The novel’s author commented that she was the ideal one to&nbsp;transmit the maturity and strength that the character required. Katniss began her adventure at&nbsp;age&nbsp;16, and at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the shooting, <a href=#>Jennifer</a> was 20. However, in&nbsp;the second picture, we&nbsp;can see how she really looked at&nbsp;age&nbsp;16, when she took part in&nbsp;the series <a href=#>The Bill Engvall Show</a>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think it’s convincing when actors play characters younger or&nbsp;older than their own age?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecCcq6iqo2LEqbuMsJyrnV2pvLWty6WwZpmSobJuwM5mp6WZqWKwqa3RmpqtnaKoerCyjJpknaGWm7Kzsc2tZJqflWKFcXyPbGxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
