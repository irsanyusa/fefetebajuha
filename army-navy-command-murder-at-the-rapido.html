A few weeks later, at the Rapido River, the Fifth Army’s Lieut. General Mark Clark committed them to one of the bloodiest engagements of the Italian campaign.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">German artillery, high in the hills, were zeroed in on the river banks. German mines were thickly sown along its shores. Major General Fred Walker, the division’s commander, thought (and told General Clark) that an attempt to cross the river at that point would be suicide. Nevertheless lean, nerveless Mark Clark ordered the attack and drove the 36th at the river for three days. In those three days the 36th lost more than 2,000 men—taken prisoner, wounded or killed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Six months later Walker was sent back to the U.S. in a training command. The 36th, with replacements, fought on, landed in southern France, fought its way into Germany. But old 36th Division men still hate no man in the world as much as they hate lanky, stubborn Mark Clark.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last week, as the 36th Division, built on a skeleton of Texas National Guardsmen, held a reunion in Brownwood, Tex., the men who still remembered the frightful days at the Rapido did what they always promised they would do. They demanded that Congress investigate the “colossal blunder [and] take the necessary steps to correct a military system that will permit an inefficient and inexperienced officer, such as General Mark W. Clark … to destroy the young manhood of this country.” Said one company commander: “I had 184 men . . . 48 hours later I had 17. If that’s not mass murder I don’t know what is.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Marines who had seen battalions melt at Tarawa and Iwo Jima might tell him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucmpnbX1wrdGmsGamkavGbq%2FOpqSappRiura%2Bw56pZpmkYsGpsYyrmKmhlKR8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
