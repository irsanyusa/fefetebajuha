The Canadian-America magician wowed on AGT Season 13 and AGT: The Champions with his sleight of hand magic. Here’s why fans of the long running series think he’s the world’s best close-up magician.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-all-of-shin-lim-s-got-talent-performances>All of Shin Lim’s Got Talent Performances</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>His AGT Audition</h3><p>During his audition, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Lim</a> asked Tyra Banks to randomly select a card, serving as the main card of his routine. From there, Lim began to create various forms of illusion through the card. The illusions included making the card appear on top of a deck of cards and imprinting the design of the card onto his skin as a tattoo. Lim also managed to make the card vanish and reappear in the deck and transform the deck of cards into a deck of clear plastic sheets.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Judge Cuts</h3><p>For his Judge Cuts routine, Lim focused on performing tricks using Queens and Aces. During the first part, he made the Queens vanish, replacing them with Aces. He then made the Aces reappear under guest judge Olivia Munn’s hand. Adding Kings into the routine, Lim then made the cards vanish and reappear in various ways.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Quarterfinals</h3><p>During the Quarterfinals, Lim’s performance consisted of changing a normal deck of cards into a different deck spelling out “Vote For Shin Lim <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a>“. He then transformed the deck into its original design, finally making it vanish again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Semi-Finals</h3><p>Lim’s Semi-Finals routine consisted of a close-up routine, with the help of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a> and Tyra Banks. He let Heidi pick and sign one card, made the marker in his hand disappear, erased the face of the card. And surprised everyone when he then extracted the card from his mouth. Afterwards, he made Banks select and sign another card, then making it appear in different places — his pocket, pants, and mouth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Finals</h3><p>During the Finale, Lim performed a close-up routine with host Tyra Banks.

In the end, he made the number and suit of the card appear among floating cards.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Finale</h3><p>In episode 1322 of season 13, Lim performed a trick with the assistance of Tyra Banks and American Ninja Warrior hosts Matt Iseman and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila.

All four then played along the deck, shuffling the sames, until Lim revealed that despite all the shuffling, Gbaja-Biamila’s card is on top of his remaining cards.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Champions Preliminary</h3><p>Coming back to defend his title, Lim’s preliminary act consisted of performing a card routine with the assistance of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Crews</a>. Performing his usual and foolproof, he’s made cards appear, vanish, and reappear. Through the cards, Lim even spelled out the word “Champions.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Champions Finals</h3><p>During his Finals performance, he asked Terry Crews and Howie Mandel to help him in his close-up act.

He had Fumero pick Queen of Diamonds and ask her to shuffle and mix the deck of cards. Subsequently, Dumero tried to stack the cards on Lim’s palm, revealing that on top of it was her card. As the performance went on, Lim made the card appear from his mouth and magically inserted a selfie of Fumero with her card on her phone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Champions Season 2, Marc Spelmann’s Return</h3><p>During The Champions season two, Marc Spelmann returned as himself, X, someone else mysterious. Spelmann started off by wearing his mask and getting into his character X. He then proceeded to play a random choice game with the judges, with Howie Mandel revealing that his favorite magician is Shin Lim. Magically, when Spelmann removed his mask, Lim was revealed to be the person behind it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Champions Guest Performance with Colin Cloud</h3><p>Lim also appeared as guest performer with Colin Cloud during The Champions season two Finale.
