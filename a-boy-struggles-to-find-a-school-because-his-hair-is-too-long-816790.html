This is&nbsp;where we&nbsp;encounter 12-year-old Farouk James. He’s gained attention on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> for his incredibly unique hair, but he’s facing challenges in&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;school that embraces his individuality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abb/854/01b10a57d4a6ca762c262a697f.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Farouk James</a>, a&nbsp;12-year-old model well-known in&nbsp;the fashion industry with a&nbsp;substantial <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> following, along with his mother Bonnie, is&nbsp;encountering difficulty finding a&nbsp;suitable school for him to&nbsp;attend. Many schools in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=# title=UK data-link=tag>UK</a> have strict rules regarding hair length, and due to&nbsp;Farouk’s long locks, they’ve been advised by&nbsp;schools to&nbsp;trim his hair before he&nbsp;can return to&nbsp;classes.</p><p>Bonnie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes</a> this treatment is&nbsp;unfair, arguing that her son’s hair is&nbsp;completely natural and not dyed or&nbsp;styled. She points out that if&nbsp;Farouk were a&nbsp;girl, the school wouldn’t object to&nbsp;his hair length, viewing this situation as&nbsp;clear discrimination.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdc/4fa/9fcf19585ab4b39c73adfacc30.jpg><p>Farouk has been blessed with incredibly thick hair that was visible even before he&nbsp;was born during prenatal scans. He&nbsp;values his long locks and gets upset when thinking about having to&nbsp;cut them to&nbsp;comply with school rules. His Instagram page promotes the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>message</a> that “hair has no&nbsp;gender” and advocates for equality. It&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;break down barriers and promote inclusivity, emphasizing that hairstyles and hair choices should not be&nbsp;limited by&nbsp;traditional gender expectations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/808/6d3/3eee82518fadef59b245b367bc.jpg><p>Before, Bonnie had enrolled Farouk’s older brother in&nbsp;a&nbsp;school where hair length had been a&nbsp;frequent issue. She had hoped that the school’s hair policy might have changed since then. Her elder son, now&nbsp;23, had faced criticism for having hair that was considered “too short.”</p><p>However, upon further exploration, Bonnie found that many of&nbsp;the school’s rules and regulations regarding appearance had remained the same. This indicated that Farouk would also need to&nbsp;cut his hair to&nbsp;comply with the school’s policy, something Bonnie was vehemently against.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acb/8dc/305d445851826dd7eba9e67add.jpg><p>Bonnie launched a&nbsp;viral campaign seeking change. She rallied support from parents encountering similar challenges, especially those with children sporting dreadlocks and Afro hairstyles. With her son by&nbsp;her side, Bonnie aims to&nbsp;challenge these seemingly arbitrary school rules, intending to&nbsp;bring about substantial and meaningful change.</p><p>“We’re getting a&nbsp;real team together and calling it&nbsp;the Mane Generation. We’re going to&nbsp;fight this until these rules get changed. And it’s globally, not just domestically in&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proclaimed</a>.</p><p>Long hair for men represents more than just a&nbsp;hairstyle; it&nbsp;embodies a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;self-expression, personal empowerment, and a&nbsp;challenge to&nbsp;societal norms. Opting for long hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;choice that mirrors <a href=#>individuality</a> and resilience, signifying one’s unique identity and inner strength.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5urs6yZKysoqq0qLjErGStp12btq%2BwjJpkrJuYpLytecGempqto5p6qbXSZp%2BaoaJitrR506imZqSfo7RuhJBvbnJoXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
