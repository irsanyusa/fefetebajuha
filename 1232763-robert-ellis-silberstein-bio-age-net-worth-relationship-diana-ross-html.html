However, he was the husband of a singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress – Diana Ross.</p><p class=align-left>Diana dated another man – the head of the company Motown – Berry Gordy. However, she, apparently, chose Robert. Bob Ellis and Diana Ross were both interrelated in a musical career and dated only two months before they got married on 20th January 1971. Their love story was not durable, and the couple got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">divorced six years later</a> on 9th March 1977. After the divorce, the journalists managed to take an interview where the man said things that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sounded quite desperate</a>:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/09cbf012804faf0e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Matt James, the first Black 'Bachelor' 25 in 2021?</span></p></a>“My wife belongs to that company [Motown]… She’s totally dominated by a man [Berry Gordy] who never read a book in his life. I just can’t stand it anymore to hear them calling Stevie Wonder a genius. What happened to Freud?”<p class=align-left>Robert Ellis Silberstein and Diana Ross <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gave birth</a> to 2 girls: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tracee Ellis Ross</a> (1972) and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chudney Ross</a> (1975). Their children are both involved in the cinema industry. Tracee is an actress, and Chudney is a producer and production manager.</p><p class=align-left>Tracee, by the way, is close to her father, in one of her interviews <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she said about him</a>:</p>“My father’s name is Robert Ellis Silberstein, and he dropped Silberstein, we all dropped Silberstein. I really felt strongly that I wanted my father’s name in my name, because everyone knows I’m my mom’s daughter, but I’m also very much my dad’s daughter. And I wanted him, when my name hit a screen, to know that I was also part of him. And so Tracee Ellis Ross it is.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/209933e71b417bcf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Taylor Zakhar Perez biography: age, parents, net worth, girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Moreover, in another interview, the lady helped to understand what kind of personality her father is (who else may know better, then his daughter?) Young miss <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ellis Ross said</a>:</p>“He’s very personable and charming. I get my sense of humour from my dad.”<p class=align-left>Although Robert Ellis Silberstein and Diana Ross shared only two mutual children, the man also cared about Ronda Suzanne Silberstein. The girl was born from the relationship of Diana and Berry Gordy (the head of Motown).</p><p class=align-left>Robert Ellis Silberstein is one of those who stayed in shadow and it sometimes even was a shadow of his starry wife, Diana Ross. However, he did not waste his time, because being an extremely active 73-year-old man, he leads a joyful and energetic life, and you will not see him on the photos without a sincere smile.</p><p></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Anne Hathaway husband Adam Shulman bio: age, height, net worth</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN%2FkXBtbGWipK%2BmvtNmnKWkmah6tLXLm5yrq6Satq95waKmZpmXmnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16s7HLmquip56otaq8jJ2gmqaRYr%2Bwv9Jnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
