Have him aim for that, or lean forward more and push yourself back into him to get there, she says. What makes this move even better? You both have easy clit access, so use your hands or a vibe to have a clitoral <a href=# id=857411fc-426f-4974-86f7-4e7ebba8b3d2>orgasm</a> firstthat blood flow will cause the G-spot to swell, making it larger and easier to reach for a second big O.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Do It:</strong> Get into the spooning position with him as the big spoon.
