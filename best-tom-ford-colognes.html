The danger of a high-end cologne is its price tag might do the same. While Tom Ford’s colognes certainly have a reputation for being expensive, they’re also known for being one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best colognes for men</a>, due to their longevity and the quality of their ingredients. Which of the brand’s many fragrances is right for you, though? We’ve rounded up the best Tom Ford colognes to make your nose happy (and your wallet considerably less so—sorry).</p><h2 id=how-to-buy-tom-ford-colognes->How to buy Tom Ford colognes</h2><p>“When buying a cologne, get a trial size first and see how it wears for a week before investing in a full-size bottle,” advises beauty and lifestyle blogger <a rel=nofollow href=#>Julianna Lepore</a>. “Everyone has slightly different chemistry and PH levels, so while a scent might wear amazingly on a family member or friend, it might not be best suited for you.” In terms of <a rel=alternate href=#>how to apply cologne</a>, Lepore advises that you “don’t rub these fragrances in, as most fragrances are best if you just let them settle into your skin.”</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-tom-ford-colognes>Our top picks for the best Tom Ford colognes</h2><h3>Best woody Tom Ford cologne: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Oud Wood</a></h3><p>Was there really any other choice here? The name says it all, with incredibly fresh, woody top notes balanced out by the warmth of the oud (a fragrant oil derived from tree resin, just in case you were worried there wasn’t enough wood in this). “It’s an earthy and woody scent inspired by smoky, incense-filled temples and rare, precious oud,” remarks stylist and celebrity business strategist <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nina Vargas</a>. Lepore also has this as her top pick, describing it as, “Very dense and woody, with a little hint of spice.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 10ml, 30ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Mild to moderate</li><li>Price on publish: $70-$425</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Fresh</li><li>Versatile</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews complain of poor longevity, and regard it as overpriced as a result</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A beautifully outdoorsy smell that also works perfectly for everyday office wear.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best woody Tom Ford cologne</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1855618-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Oud Wood Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL" title="TOM FORD Oud Wood Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Oud Wood Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL</h3></p><h3>Best spicy Tom Ford cologne: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Soleil Brûlant</a></h3><p>Described by Vargas as, “spicy, with hints of amber, honey and orange,” this is a complex scent that blends its top notes of pink pepper, orange, and bergamot with a sweet middle layer of honey and orange blossom, all resting on top of a rich, earthy base layer of resin, amber, leather, and vetiver. It tends to be a bit of a “you love it or hate it” scent, but that’s what makes it interesting.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 10ml, 30ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Strong</li><li>Price on publish: $80-$595</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Complex</li><li>Interesting</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some may find the initial impression to be a little harsh or bitter</li><li>Very expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A rich, spicy scent that despite its summery name and appearance, might be better suited to autumn.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best spicy Tom Ford cologne</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2541506-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Soleil Brulant Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz / 30 mL" title="TOM FORD Soleil Brulant Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz / 30 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Soleil Brulant Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz / 30 mL</h3></p><h3>Best Tom Ford fragrance for winter: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tobacco Vanille</a></h3><p>If you’re heading into the holiday season, it’s tough to argue with a scent that brings to mind festive evenings by the fireplace, sharing sweet treats, with a hint of some distant uncle’s pipe smoke lingering in the air (look, maybe we didn’t all get to live in a Norman Rockwell fantasy, but we can pretend, can’t we?) Described by Vargas as, “A warm and spicy eau de parfum that reinvents classic tobacco,” this is one of Ford’s most notoriously long-lasting efforts, so be prepared to live with the scent for a while.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 10ml, 30ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Very strong</li><li>Price on publish: $70 - $425</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sweet</li><li>Festive</li><li>Long-lasting</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Might be overpowering to some</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A rich, sweet, and incredibly long-lasting fragrance that captures the holiday season impeccably.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best Tom Ford fragrance for winter</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1449289-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Tobacco Vanille Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1.7 oz/ 50 mL" title="TOM FORD Tobacco Vanille Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1.7 oz/ 50 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Tobacco Vanille Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1.7 oz/ 50 mL</h3></p><h3>Best Tom Ford fragrance for spring: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eau de Soleil Blanc</a></h3><p>Vargas recommends this as the perfect fresh accompaniment to delightful, if unreliable, spring weather. Sunny yet subtle, it features citrusy top notes with a touch of pistachio on top of a highly floral middle layer, while the base notes are comprised of a richer, tropical blend of coconut, vanilla, and amber. You’ll be happy wearing this no matter how many surprise rainstorms you get caught in.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 10ml, 30ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Moderate</li><li>Price on publish: $50 - $225</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>On the less expensive side (relatively speaking)</li><li>Beachy, but without smelling like sunscreen</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews claim it’s a little too sweet for warmer weather</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A fresh, well-balanced fragrance that works for spring while getting you in the mood for summer.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best Tom Ford fragrance for spring</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2318772-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Eau de Soleil Blanc Eau de Toilette Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL" title="TOM FORD Eau de Soleil Blanc Eau de Toilette Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Eau de Soleil Blanc Eau de Toilette Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL</h3></p><h3>Best Tom Ford fragrance for summer: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Costa Azzurra</a></h3><p>Summer scents can be hit or miss, often straying too far into sweet or tropical territory, with the end result that you either smell like sunscreen or a discarded popsicle. That’s why Lepore likes Costa Azzurra, “A great summer scent that smells like fresh air with hints of salty amber.” With top notes of seaweed and driftwood layered over citrusy, floral heart notes and sweet, earthy bass notes, it’s pure, distilled vacation in a bottle.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 50ml or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Moderate</li><li>Price on publish: $155 - $225</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Fresh</li><li>Not your typical, overly sweet summer fragrance</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Might not work for those who don’t enjoy more aquatic scents</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An elegant, fresh, and aromatic fragrance that captures the spirit of summer travel.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best Tom Ford fragrance for summer</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2408300-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Costa Azzurra Eau de Parfum Fragrance 3.4 oz/ 100 mL" title="TOM FORD Costa Azzurra Eau de Parfum Fragrance 3.4 oz/ 100 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Costa Azzurra Eau de Parfum Fragrance 3.4 oz/ 100 mL</h3></p><h3>Best Tom Ford fragrance for fall: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tuscan Leather</a></h3><p>Vargas and Lepore agree on Tuscan Leather as the ideal fall scent, describing it as, “earthy and woody,” and, “a lovely, warm, and spicy fragrance with hints of saffron,” respectively. As an accompaniment to traipsing through crunchy, fallen leaves, it’s hard to beat, with its deep base notes of leather and suede offset by the brightness of its herbal top notes.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 30ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Very strong</li><li>Price on publish: $185 - $425</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sophisticated</li><li>Distinctive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of customer reviews regard it as too dry and smoky</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An intense, complex fragrance that fades to a deep, rewarding, autumnal scent.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best Tom Ford fragrance for fall</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2038875-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Tuscan Leather Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL" title="TOM FORD Tuscan Leather Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Tuscan Leather Eau de Parfum Fragrance 1 oz/ 30 mL</h3></p><h3>Best Tom Ford unisex fragrance: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cherry Smoke</a></h3><p>It should be noted first that, really, all fragrances are unisex: The idea that some scents are for women and others are for men is wildly outdated. So whether you’re a lady who loves leather or a fella who loves floral, just go for it! All of that said, Lepore’s pick for the best unisex Tom Ford fragrance, Cherry Smoke, hits the sweet spot between the two traditional camps, pairing fruity cherry and apricot with more savory olive and saffron, with a smoky, woody base layer to finish it off.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 30ml or 50ml</li><li>Lasting power: Moderate</li><li>Price on publish: $250-$395</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Romantic</li><li>Elegant</li><li>Luxurious</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some users feel there’s not enough smoke for the name</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A classic unisex fragrance with a touch of hedonistic luxury.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best Tom Ford unisex fragrance</span></p><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Cherry Smoke Eau de Parfum at Nordstrom, Size 1 Oz</h3></p><h3>Best bold Tom Ford cologne: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fucking Fabulous</a></h3><p>If you’re going to go bold, you may as well own it, right? That’s what Ford has done with Fucking Fabulous, Lepore’s preferred bold scent from the line, which she admires for being, “seductive and rich, with a long-lasting effect.” Its blend of lavender, sage, leather, almond, and caramel-y tonka bean doesn’t sound like it should work on paper, but it does—fabulously.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 10ml, 30ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting power: Strong</li><li>Price on publish: $80-$595</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Unusual</li><li>Seductive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Very expensive</li><li>Not for everyone</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Another divisive option, it may be too overpowering for some, but if you love it, you love it.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best bold Tom Ford cologne</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2174225-main-zoom.jpg alt="TOM FORD Fucking Fabulous Eau de Parfum Fragrance 3.4 oz/ 100 mL" title="TOM FORD Fucking Fabulous Eau de Parfum Fragrance 3.4 oz/ 100 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Fucking Fabulous Eau de Parfum Fragrance 3.4 oz/ 100 mL</h3></p><h3>Best aquatic Tom Ford cologne: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mandarino Di Amalfi</a></h3><p>Going by the sheer number of customer reviews that say this scent makes them feel like they’re sitting by the pool, this had to be our pick for the best aquatic scent. Lepore agrees, adding that it’s, “Very fresh and fruity–it smells like a beach breeze!” With citrusy, herbal top notes that turn beautifully musky in the dry-down, it adds a gentle kick of black pepper and coriander, just to stop you drifting off.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance type: Eau de parfum</li><li>Size: 50ml</li><li>Lasting power: Mild to moderate</li><li>Price on publish: $295</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Clean</li><li>Fresh</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not much longevity for a Tom Ford fragrance</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Another ideal vacation scent that lives up to its Italian coastal name.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best aquatic Tom Ford cologne</span></p><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Private Blend Mandarino di Amalfi Eau de Parfum at Nordstrom, Size 1.7 Oz</h3></p><h3>Best leather Tom Ford cologne: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ombré Leather</a></h3><p>A more accessible scent than the aforementioned <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tuscan Leather</a>, this is a more straightforward, leather-heavy affair, with a little cardamon, patchouli, and amber rounding out its more traditionally masculine profile. “It smells like rich leather, with hints of floral tones and the desert,” according to Lepore, but it softens over time and becomes somewhat sweeter, thanks to the inclusion of jasmine in the heart notes.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fragrance Type: Parfum</li><li>Size: 10ml, 50ml, or 100ml</li><li>Lasting Power: Very strong</li><li>Price on publish: $65 - $275</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>On the more affordable end for a Tom Ford fragrance</li><li>Distinctive</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A few reviews find it to be too strong or overbearing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A classic, rugged fragrance designed to evoke the bygone days of the American west.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best leather Tom Ford cologne</span></p><p><h3 class=title>TOM FORD Ombre Leather Parfum</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-tom-ford-colognes->How we selected the Best Tom Ford colognes</h2><p>We made our selections by consulting with experts, thoroughly researching each scent on fragrance review sites such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fragrantica</a> to ensure universally positive customer feedback, and of course, whether or not each scent passed the good old fashioned smell test.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faq>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2><h3>Which Tom Ford cologne is best smelling?</h3><p>This is entirely subjective, of course, but our experts were happy to weigh in. “I personally like to use perfume based on the occasion, but a crowd favorite has to be <a rel=nofollow href=#>Black Orchid</a>,” says Vargas. “Aside from the chic black and gold packaging, the scent is well balanced—it has a floral fruitiness that’s never too sweet, thanks to hints of patchouli that keep it grounded.”</p><p>Lepore, meanwhile, opts for <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fucking Fabulous</a>. “It smells like the name, it’s amazing!” she enthuses. “I have yet to meet someone who doesn’t like this scent.”</p><h3>Which Tom Ford perfume lasts the longest?</h3><p>The general consensus is that the more vanilla-heavy fragrances have the greatest sillage and longevity, with <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tobacco Vanille</a> being the most notorious (Lepore claims it has a longevity of 16 hours, while some online reviews insist they can still smell it after three days).</p><p>“It’s often joked that you better love the Tom Ford cologne before you spray it on, as it’s meant to last,” says Vargas. “Going back to the famous <a rel=nofollow href=#>Black Orchid</a>, this perfume can easily last up to ten hours, thanks to its high concentration of perfume oils.”</p><h3>Which Tom Ford cologne is the most popular?</h3><p>Along with the aforementioned <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tobacco Vanille</a>, Tom Ford’s best sellers tend to include the earthy, smoky <a rel=nofollow href=#>Oud Wood</a>, and–perhaps at least in part due to its lower price point–the more classically masculine, spicy <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ombre Leather</a>.</p><h3>Which Tom Ford perfume is seductive?</h3><p>Again, this is entirely subjective, and browsing fragrance reviews will uncover a ton of wildly differing opinions. That said, numerous people and publications cite <a rel=nofollow href=#>Black Orchid</a> as one of the most traditionally seductive scents, with others claiming everything from <a rel=nofollow href=#>Orchid Soleil</a> to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jasmin Rouge</a>. In terms of our own experts, Lepore leans towards <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ombre Leather</a>, while we already know Vargas is another <a rel=nofollow href=#>Black Orchid</a> fan.</p><h3>Why are Tom Ford perfumes so expensive?</h3><p>“It’s what’s known as Salon Perfume (the materials are expensive, the output is small, the price is high, and there is a strong creative style), plus, Tom Ford carries a lot of prestige and mystique in fashion circles,” says Vargas. “Although subjective, it’s easily said that of all the luxury brands creating scents, Tom Ford’s fragrance line is one of the best. They’re universally long-lasting, have unique ingredients, and are housed in stunning bottles that look gorgeous.”</p><p>Lepore adds that, “Tom Ford is definitely a brand that’s marketed toward middle to higher end consumers, but that being said, they do last, and many people agree they’re worth the investment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lpKS6brLOq5tmm5%2BhvKi6xKxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
