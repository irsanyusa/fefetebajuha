The singer took to Instagram to get his fans amped up for the new show. Femuline will kick-off on March 12 in Seattle, WA. The entertainer is surely ready to let loose after his stressful time on Season 3 of <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a>.</strong></p><p>The promotional video has Hall’s setlist in the form of miss calls. The phone number that shows is a new way that celebrities market themselves to their fans. Joining a celebrity text list is how fans stay in the know about their favorite celebrities. Hall’s 301 number is sure to have news on discounted ticket rates and early access to tickets for added shows.</p><p>The list includes Halls hits such as “Rainin Fellas,” “Dripeesha,” and “Boys in the Ocean.” The Femuline tour is based off of Hall’s 2021 album of the same name. Songs from the Celebrity Big Brother alum’s Femuline Gaymeova will also be performed as well throughout the show.</p><p>Hall will perform close to 40 songs each night of his tour. With that many songs, his show will last over two hours. Some of the singer’s singles are shorter songs, so fans can expect to leave at a decent time. With the weather warming up I am sure partying all-night with the “Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels,’ singer will not be an issue.</p><p>Although Hall is extravagant, his shows are usually on a smaller intimate scale. Just a day ago he posted that his first day of rehearsal was successful.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-todrick-hall-s-life-after-celebrity-big-brother>Todrick Hall’s Life After ‘Celebrity Big Brother’</h2><p>Hall was all smiles with his backup dancers as they rehearsed for the upcoming tour. Now with his focus on the music, he can put his <a href=#>Season 3 Celebrity Big Brother</a> drama behind him.</p><p>Hall learned a hard lesson this past season of the hit competition show. Although he came in second place, he made headlines and faced harsh backlash for some of his comments and game play. The former Masked Singer contestant did take home the $50,000 second place cash prize.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1353288248.jpg alt="Jennifer Hudson Lands Daytime Talk Show Premiering This Fall" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>todrick hall</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706ibq6GToHqprculZKudnJqutLHSZqqerJyewLV5xaipZq2gmLyutc2gZJ%2Bdnaq5qrrEZquoraJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
