Tom Holland is&nbsp;a&nbsp;ballet dancer and an&nbsp;acrobat.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7b/706/12151c5c53b25b699a2c44a47a.jpg><p>Invision / Invision / East News<span>, </span>Album Online / East News</p><p>When <a href=# title="Tom Holland" data-link=tag>Tom Holland</a> auditioned for the role of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Spider-Man data-link=tag>Spider-Man</a>, he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;convince the producers that he&nbsp;was the perfect choice by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>somersaulting</a> in&nbsp;and out of&nbsp;his audition video. He&nbsp;also said that for every tape he&nbsp;sent&nbsp;in, he&nbsp;showed off a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;his acrobatic skills. Not only did his gymnastic abilities help him get the role, but they also came in&nbsp;handy since Holland ended up&nbsp;doing most of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stunts</a> himself.</p><p>His background in&nbsp;dancing helped with his acting as&nbsp;well. When he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;10-year-old boy, he&nbsp;learned <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ballet</a> and was criticized by&nbsp;others for&nbsp;it. But his training proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;useful, and his knowledge of&nbsp;body movement helped him emote in&nbsp;different ways. “For instance, in&nbsp;the Spider-Man suit, you often can’t see his face. But I&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;convey feeling anyway,” he&nbsp;explained.</p><p><h2>2. Paris Hilton loves frog hunting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/018/50d/e120de574faf1e23ef3631a084.jpg><p>Getting down and dirty to&nbsp;catch amphibians is&nbsp;not something we&nbsp;would imagine a&nbsp;hotel heiress doing, but <a href=# title="Paris Hilton" data-link=tag>Paris Hilton</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman of&nbsp;many surprises. She is&nbsp;against animal hunting, but there is&nbsp;one exception&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>frogs</a>. The socialite and&nbsp;DJ admitted that she goes to&nbsp;either her ranch or&nbsp;her private island to&nbsp;catch these croakers. But afterward, she releases them back into the wild.</p><p><h2>3. Keanu Reeves was a&nbsp;great hockey player in&nbsp;his younger years.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4eb/1cd/6184f1542988bd6f33cd8c16f2.jpg><p>Before he&nbsp;became John Wick or&nbsp;Constantine, <a href=# title="Keanu Reeves" data-link=tag>Keanu Reeves</a> was known to&nbsp;his college peers as&nbsp;“The Wall” because of&nbsp;his excellent blocking skills as&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice hockey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>goalie</a>. He&nbsp;received “Most Valuable Player” awards, and had the potential to&nbsp;be&nbsp;drafted into the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Canadian Olympic team.</p><p>But much like his character Neo, who had to&nbsp;choose between the blue and red pill, Reeves decided to&nbsp;choose his acting career over sports. However, he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;show his athletic side when he&nbsp;played the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hockey player in&nbsp;the 1986&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>film</a>, <i>Youngblood</i>.</p><p><h2>4. Kesha creates crafts out of&nbsp;human teeth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14e/216/896bae54348d5759925e417973.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2012, the singer/songwriter made a&nbsp;strange request to&nbsp;her fans&nbsp;— she asked them to&nbsp;send their teeth to&nbsp;her. And loyalty seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong suit of&nbsp;her fan base, as&nbsp;she received over 1,000 pearly whites. She mentioned in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, “I&nbsp;made it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;bra top, and a&nbsp;headdress, and earrings, and necklaces. I’ve worn it&nbsp;out!”</p><p><h2>5. Harry Styles developed a&nbsp;passion for knitting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c9/7f4/c7a6eb5f3fa70c501f3277f2d7.jpg><p>The stylish Styles (pun intended) can pull off any type of&nbsp;clothes, and it&nbsp;looks like he’s got the skills to&nbsp;make outfits too. Before One Direction disbanded, they went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;world tour, and the idle time reignited his interest in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knitting</a>. A&nbsp;source revealed that Styles did it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot while they were on&nbsp;the road, and that he&nbsp;used it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;unwind after hearing fans scream all day.</p><p><h2>6. Nicole Kidman enjoys indulging in&nbsp;crawly creatures.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17d/9d7/9e68f458e1976924bcf49830af.jpg><p>She is&nbsp;an&nbsp;award-winning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a>, producer, wife, and mother, but perhaps we&nbsp;can add one more title under her belt&nbsp;— “bug connoisseur.” In&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>, <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> revealed that her secret talent is&nbsp;gorging on&nbsp;grubs. “2&nbsp;billion people in&nbsp;the world eat bugs, and I’m one of&nbsp;them,” she proudly said before feasting on&nbsp;worms and insects. And in&nbsp;case you’re wondering, she described these bugs as&nbsp;fruity, exquisite, moist, and chewy.</p><p><h2>7. Sir Rod Stewart built a&nbsp;model railway city.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b5/5ad/f54c9f5191ac070d070195c0f0.jpg><p>When he’s not performing onstage, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knighted</a> music legend spends his time building a&nbsp;miniature and very intricate replica of&nbsp;a&nbsp;city, complete with establishments and railways. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>project</a> has taken him 20+&nbsp;years to&nbsp;finish, and within that time span, he&nbsp;released 13&nbsp;studio albums and completed 19&nbsp;tours.</p><p>Photos of&nbsp;his work showed detailed buildings, bridges, ships, and streets with vintage cars and cabs. Sir Stewart also said that the structures and sceneries were his forte, but he&nbsp;needed help with the electrical part of&nbsp;the model.</p><p><h2>8. Dwayne Johnson can rock a&nbsp;ukulele.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68c/eec/a51b075ac59ddf430101c93e58.jpg><p>The former pro wrestler traces his roots back to&nbsp;his Polynesian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heritage</a>. He&nbsp;has always been proud of&nbsp;this culture, so&nbsp;when he&nbsp;saw an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;showcase his ukulele-playing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>skills</a> in&nbsp;his movie, <i>Journey&nbsp;2: The Mysterious Island</i>, he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;suggestion to&nbsp;the director to&nbsp;incorporate it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;scene. And the musical genes definitely run in&nbsp;the Johnson family, as&nbsp;proven by&nbsp;this endearing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> of&nbsp;The Rock’s mom playing the ukulele as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>9. Elliot Page has pretty impressive juggling skills.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/147/19c/f77502575fa49388dfb7d4e286.jpg><p>When Conan O’Brien <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> <i>The Umbrella Academy </i>actor what his other talents were, Elliot Page mentioned that he&nbsp;could juggle. O’Brien then put him on&nbsp;the spot with a&nbsp;bowl of&nbsp;fruits and potatoes, and luckily, Page was a&nbsp;good sport and quickly demonstrated his party trick. “I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;on&nbsp;film sets, and you have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;free time, basically. So&nbsp;this is&nbsp;like the loneliness and sadness of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child,” Page jokingly quipped.</p><p><h2>10. Emma Stone is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pro when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;pogo sticks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96c/20f/81e6785e74acd44f6ba1afff6a.jpg><p>The <i>La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land </i>star has been dubbed as&nbsp;“America’s Sweetheart,” and she<i> </i>just solidified her status after showing off her adorable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pogo</a> stick skills. Apparently, she did it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid until she was about 11&nbsp;years old. And in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>this video</a>, she teaches&nbsp;us how to&nbsp;hoist ourselves up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the pogo stick and bounce around in&nbsp;circles.</p><p>If&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;audition for a&nbsp;talent show, what kind of&nbsp;performance or&nbsp;skill would you show the judges?
