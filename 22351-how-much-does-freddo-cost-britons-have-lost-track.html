Britons have lost track</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><h3><strong>Only one in nine gave us the 25p answer</strong></h3><p>Tesco is temporarily <a href=#>slashing the price of Cadbury’s Freddo</a> – the anthropomorphic chocolate frog invented in 1930 – to the historic price of 10p as part of its centenary celebrations.</p><p>Those of us of a certain age will remember this as the traditional cost of a Freddo, which remained stubbornly static from its introduction in the UK in 1994 until 2007. It may have been a mistake on Cadbury’s part to have kept the price fixed for so long, as it now can’t increase the cost of the treat without making <a href=#>headlines</a>.</p><p><a href=#>YouGov Omnibus</a> asked Britons what they thought the current price of a Freddo bar was. The results reveal a horrendous lack of awareness. Only 11% gave the correct 25p RRP price set by Cadbury (although that’s not to say higher answers aren’t correct in some less scrupulous shops).</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Freddos-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Overall, 14% of Brits gave a price lower than 25p, including 8% who said 20p (the price of a Freddo in 2011) and 2% who gave the classic cost of 10p.</p><p>More than a third of Brits (38%) gave a value higher than 25p, with the most commonly given options in this range being 30p at 10% (the price of a Freddo from March 2017 to March 2018 before Cadbury responded to popular outrage and reduced the price back to 25p), while another 7% said 50p.</p><p>A further 41% refrained from guessing and admitted that they didn’t know how much it cost in the first place.</p><p>A <a href=#>2017 Buzzfeed study</a> previously found that the price increases in Freddo bars have far outstripped inflation since 2000 – fully 200% at the time, whereas general inflation had only seen prices rise 42%.</p><p>While the famous frog is a cultural icon among those of a certain age, it’s far from the most beloved chocolatey treat in Britain.</p><p>YouGov Ratings shows that <a href=#>53% of Britons have a positive opinion of Freddos</a>, rising to 66% among Millennials. Even among this age group, however, this is only enough to secure a rank of 49th most popular confectionary – far behind the 87% that first placed Cadbury Buttons receive.</p><p>Photo: <a href=#>Alpha</a> via Flickr</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmeAdn2MoaawZZ2qsKl5w6icrGWWp7KlsM5mmqirpGKvs7XTqKWsZZiWw6Z5y6iqrWWkp66ktw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
