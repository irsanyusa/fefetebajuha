I even said, ‘Bro I think you got that one, big dog,” <a href=#>NBC reports that</a> Lyles told Thompson before the scoreboard revealed that the Florida native crossed the finish line with a time of 9.784 seconds.

After that point, the track-and-field star became even more determined. “I’m here to race anybody who wants it,” <a href=#>Lyles told TIME in an interviewer earlier this year</a>. “The deeper the field, the better I run. I know I’m going to win. Because I’m never going to break nerve.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This marks the first U.S. gold in this event since 2004.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lyles is also hoping to medal in the 200m race, for which he is the favorite.
