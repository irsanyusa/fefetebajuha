However, the life of&nbsp;their patriarch, Dhirubhai, was quite different from that of&nbsp;his children.</p><p>Starting from humble beginnings, Dhirubhai began his entrepreneurial journey by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>selling</a> fried food to&nbsp;pilgrims on&nbsp;weekends and working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;petrol attendant. He’s credited with revolutionizing the business scene in&nbsp;<a href=# title=India data-link=tag>India</a>. This is&nbsp;the inspiring tale of&nbsp;the man behind <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reliance Industries</a>, whose influential legacy will always be&nbsp;remembered.</p><p><h2>It’s Indian industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani in&nbsp;the photo below, with guests at&nbsp;the wedding of&nbsp;his son Mukesh Ambani to&nbsp;Nita Ambani, Mumbai, circa 1985.</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dhirubhai Ambani</a> was born in&nbsp;1932 in&nbsp;the small village of&nbsp;Chorwad, Gujarat, where he&nbsp;led a&nbsp;modest life. His father worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher in&nbsp;a&nbsp;village school. From a&nbsp;young age, Dhirubhai showed a&nbsp;keen interest in&nbsp;money-making ventures. He&nbsp;often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>skipped</a> school to&nbsp;observe people selling goods in&nbsp;the streets.</p><p>Even though his mom didn’t like it&nbsp;when he&nbsp;skipped school, Dhirubhai was determined to&nbsp;make money. He&nbsp;started <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>selling</a> bhajias, a&nbsp;tasty fried snack, on&nbsp;weekends. After he&nbsp;finished school, he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;Yemen. There, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;job at&nbsp;a&nbsp;big trading company, doing odd jobs like pumping gas and working in&nbsp;the office.</p><p><h2>Dhirubhai worked hard and moved up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the company.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d67/fcf/c8b718556495e474efb5378053.jpg><p>AP/Associated Press/East News</p><p>He&nbsp;saved every penny he&nbsp;earned with the dream of&nbsp;coming back home to&nbsp;start his own business. This time away laid the groundwork for his future success as&nbsp;an&nbsp;entrepreneur. With the money he&nbsp;had saved from his job, Dhirubhai ventured into the import and export of&nbsp;polyester yarn and established his own company.</p><p>Later&nbsp;on, he&nbsp;founded Reliance Commercial Corporation. This move turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;highly profitable. However, despite his success, Ambani and his family lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small flat for years before eventually upgrading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;larger home in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>renowned</a> Altamount Road area of&nbsp;South Mumbai.</p><h2>Today, Reliance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oversees</a> a&nbsp;vast network of&nbsp;over 230&nbsp;subsidiaries.</h2><p>He&nbsp;laid the groundwork for Reliance in&nbsp;1958, starting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;commodity-trading firm. Transitioning from trading spices and polyester yarn, Dhirubhai shifted focus to&nbsp;polyester production, establishing Reliance Industries Private Limited in&nbsp;Maharashtra, India, in&nbsp;1966. Following Dhirubhai’s passing in&nbsp;2002, Mukesh and his brother Anil took over leadership responsibilities. Eventually, Mukesh gained majority control.</p><p>Reliance Industries remains a&nbsp;family affair, with Mukesh’s three children each taking charge of&nbsp;different sectors within the company. Recently, they officially joined the company’s board, with Akash leading the telecom and broadband division, Isha overseeing retail and financial services, and <a href=#><strong>Anant heading the energy sector</strong></a>.</p><p>Preview photo credit ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News<span>, </span>AP/Associated Press/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ydn6KqpZe1orWMmqSbmZ6eeq7Byp6qoWWRoq%2BiusisZJ2ZlGLAta3RrZydZZGotqK%2FjKugnKCVqMFussCmoKWxXZfCtLXNnqqsZZanvK550p6jpaGenHqnvsiem2aen6SxboSQcWdpaV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
