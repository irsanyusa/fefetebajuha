If&nbsp;this sounds familiar and if&nbsp;you keep asking yourself, “What am&nbsp;I doing wrong?” stop torturing yourself: it’s not about you. Kids have their reasons, and these reasons are actually good.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> we&nbsp;found out why kids tend to&nbsp;misbehave when their mom is&nbsp;around, and here’s what the experts say.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;tantrum is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mode of&nbsp;communication, and this is&nbsp;how your kid says, “I&nbsp;need you, mom!”.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/585/b79/cbe842521c90191f19468724ea.jpg><p>If&nbsp;your kid’s speech is&nbsp;not that elaborate yet, it’s pretty natural that they try to&nbsp;attract your attention in&nbsp;whatever way they can. For any child, their mom is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a> of&nbsp;their basic needs, be&nbsp;that food or&nbsp;safety, and that’s why they become more emotional when their mom is&nbsp;around. Here’s how an&nbsp;expert in&nbsp;parenting and education, Dr. Ann Corwin, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a> this phenomenon:</p><p>“Mothers symbolize needs for children, and biologically, kids are wired to&nbsp;<strong>associate the need for food and survival with their mom</strong>. That is&nbsp;why kids will escalate their behavior to&nbsp;get attention (a&nbsp;connection) from their mom in&nbsp;any way they can. Dads, on&nbsp;the other hand, symbolize trust, taking risks, and playing for kids. So&nbsp;kids don’t get so&nbsp;desperate for that critical attention from their fathers since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;innate survival attachment.”</p><p><h2>You are your kid’s comfort zone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4b/356/2ba6b057fcb7a7398d00936b9f.jpg><p>Kids don’t tend to&nbsp;show their whole range of&nbsp;emotions with people they don’t trust. If&nbsp;you think that your child saves “the worst” for you, their mom, that’s not actually true. They “honor” you with their tantrums and whining, because <strong>that’s the way they <a href=#>show</a> you that they trust you </strong>and feel secure when you are near. So, acting up&nbsp;can, in&nbsp;fact, be&nbsp;the way your child says, “I&nbsp;feel safe and comfortable when I’m with you, Mom.”</p><p><h2>Here’s what you can&nbsp;do, if&nbsp;your child saves all their tantrums exclusively for you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c5/00b/749ecb5956a044a0a39e76fea3.jpg><p>We’ve found that it’s not actually a&nbsp;bad thing when your child is&nbsp;acting out in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you, their mom. But should you just silently tolerate their misbehavior? Experts believe you shouldn’t. Here are some ways to&nbsp;teach your child how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;kinder to&nbsp;their mom and keep your nerves intact.</p><ul><li><strong>Accept your kid’s tantrums</strong> and don’t take them personally. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Give</a> your kid time and space for a&nbsp;tantrum&nbsp;— just make sure they don’t hurt themselves or&nbsp;anyone around them.</li><li><strong>Give your child a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;vent</strong>. If&nbsp;your kid attends daycare or&nbsp;school, they have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“good” the whole day, and being themselves when they come back home is&nbsp;what they need. A&nbsp;tantrum is&nbsp;not the only way to&nbsp;vent, and you can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>offer</a> some alternatives: running around, having fun in&nbsp;the backyard, or&nbsp;maybe drawing or&nbsp;reading a&nbsp;story out loud.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8aa/afc/aeb1df5ffea93e5d3d1e317392.jpg><ul><li><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Delegate</strong></a><strong> some of&nbsp;the chores</strong> to&nbsp;your partner. Once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;while, ask your partner to&nbsp;bathe your child or&nbsp;feed them so&nbsp;that you can relax a&nbsp;little bit.</li><li><strong>Talk to&nbsp;your child</strong> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explain</a> how you feel if&nbsp;they’re grown enough to&nbsp;understand. And don’t let them take advantage of&nbsp;you. Even though acting out in&nbsp;your presence is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;trust, as&nbsp;we’ve just learned, you should maintain and keep enforcing <a href=# title=discipline data-link=tag>discipline</a>. Help your child understand that Mommy is&nbsp;always there to&nbsp;comfort and support them, but she has feelings, and they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;respected.</li></ul><p>Do&nbsp;you have kids?
