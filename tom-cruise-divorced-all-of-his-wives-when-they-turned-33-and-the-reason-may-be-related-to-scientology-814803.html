But when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;his personal life, things have gotten a&nbsp;bit rocky. He’s been <a href=# title=married data-link=tag>married</a> and divorced 3&nbsp;times, and each time it’s been a&nbsp;major <a href=# title=gossip data-link=tag>gossip</a> story. Strangely enough, there’s a&nbsp;weird similarity between all these splits.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;got married 3&nbsp;times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d62/703/5acb9257d18ca97912e87a152d.jpg><p>SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>It&nbsp;was May&nbsp;9, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1987</a>, when Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers took the walk down the aisle. They didn’t throw a&nbsp;massive Hollywood bash&nbsp;— instead, they opted for a&nbsp;more intimate gathering. At&nbsp;the time, Tom Cruise was making a&nbsp;name for himself, while Mimi was already an&nbsp;established actress and producer. Their wedding might not have been splashed all over the tabloids, but it&nbsp;marked a&nbsp;moment when 2&nbsp;Hollywood talents came together.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&nbsp;didn’t have the longevity many hoped for. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1990</a>, after 3&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, they went their separate ways. The reasons behind their split remained relatively private, giving rise to&nbsp;speculations.</p><p>Years after their divorce, Mimi <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>, “What did annoy me&nbsp;was the age thing. Every 6&nbsp;months, the press seemed to&nbsp;add another year to&nbsp;my&nbsp;age. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;were still married, the press would have me&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;60s by&nbsp;now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e1/3f8/216a8c5481891fd57a4188b7c7.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot / East News</p><p>Less than a&nbsp;year after finalizing his divorce from Mimi Rogers, Tom and <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a>, another well-known figure in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, tied the knot. Their marriage became a&nbsp;widely recognized and frequently discussed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>partnership</a>.</p><p>Even though they initially seemed like a&nbsp;glamorous and happy couple, Cruise and Kidman faced their fair share of&nbsp;challenges in&nbsp;their marriage. In&nbsp;2001, after being together for 11&nbsp;years and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopting</a> 2&nbsp;kids, they publicly announced their separation, finalizing their divorce later that same year.</p><p>They mostly kept the specific reasons for their split private, but years after, reflecting on&nbsp;her marriage to&nbsp;Cruise, Kidman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;young when&nbsp;I got married. I&nbsp;look back now, and I’m like, ’What?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a10/19b/1bd2105518a4cdaffe2341f91d.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Tom Cruise and <a href=# title="Katie Holmes" data-link=tag>Katie Holmes</a> had that love-at-first-sight thing going&nbsp;on. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>connection</a> was so&nbsp;intense that they decided to&nbsp;tie the knot just 2&nbsp;months after meeting. Their wedding, in&nbsp;November 2006, was a&nbsp;total spectacle at&nbsp;a&nbsp;stunning Italian castle. The guest list was a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;big-shot Hollywood names and other important folks.</p><p>Then, out of&nbsp;the blue in&nbsp;2012, after 6&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, they dropped the bombshell of&nbsp;their divorce. It&nbsp;felt like it&nbsp;happened in&nbsp;the blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye, and Katie Holmes seemed taken aback.</p><p>But even after all that, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes both kept on&nbsp;doing their thing in&nbsp;the entertainment world. They’ve got a&nbsp;daughter named Suri, born in&nbsp;2006. The whole custody agreement and concerns about their daughter’s privacy became a&nbsp;huge deal in&nbsp;the media circus.</p><p><h2>These 3&nbsp;marriages share an&nbsp;unexpected and peculiar coincidence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ff/92c/dfb6615e72b582993e0b1302ee.jpg><p>Starting with Mimi Rogers, then Nicole Kidman, and later Katie Holmes, the actor’s sequence of&nbsp;marriages has unfolded in&nbsp;an&nbsp;intriguing way, sparking discussions about the possible reasons behind&nbsp;it. What’s intriguing is&nbsp;that all of&nbsp;these marriages ended when the women reached the age of&nbsp;33.</p><p>Interestingly, Tom Cruise has never remained married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman past the age of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>33</a>. His divorces around the age of&nbsp;33&nbsp;have sparked some curiosity. Some folks think there’s a&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;a&nbsp;special number in&nbsp;Scientology, a&nbsp;religion he’s associated with. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Scientology</a> is&nbsp;all about helping people find spiritual understanding and <a href=# title=freedom data-link=tag>freedom</a>. Just like the number 33&nbsp;symbolizes guidance, Scientology aims to&nbsp;help people grow and discover themselves.</p><p>Scientology started in&nbsp;Arizona, which happens to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 33rd parallel&nbsp;— a&nbsp;significant line on&nbsp;the globe. The number 33&nbsp;is seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;big deal in&nbsp;spiritual beliefs, like someone who guides others with wisdom. Tom Cruise is&nbsp;known for his involvement in&nbsp;Scientology and its teachings. However, we&nbsp;can’t say for sure if&nbsp;his divorces at&nbsp;33&nbsp;are directly tied to&nbsp;this number thing.</p><p>This situation bears a&nbsp;striking resemblance to&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio, who also drew attention to&nbsp;his unconventional pattern of&nbsp;dating considerably younger women and parting ways around their <a href=#>25th</a> birthdays.</p><p>Even though there’s this marriage coincidence with Tom, we&nbsp;can’t deny the amazing and unique <a href=#>soul</a> that he&nbsp;consistently shows, whether he’s in&nbsp;the spotlight or&nbsp;not.</p><p>Preview photo credit AFP/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGwuYycqa6ho5p6pbXVqKmcnZRirq24jKidZqCZqHq4tdWeqmavmJq7bsDHnrBmrKWnu6awjGxqZpmemXq1tMRmqZ6Zo6S7brnAsmSbnV2nsq2t056bZqyfYsCktcSnq6ikn5zGboSQbW9pa18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
