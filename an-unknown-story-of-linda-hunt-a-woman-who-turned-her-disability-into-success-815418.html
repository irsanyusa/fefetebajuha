Unlike some stars who only need to&nbsp;display their <a href=# title=talent data-link=tag>talent</a> to&nbsp;succeed in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, Linda had to&nbsp;work much harder to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accepted as&nbsp;herself. She faced sadness and letdowns, but her determination to&nbsp;never accept less led her to&nbsp;become the star she is&nbsp;today.</p><p><h2>Linda’s childhood was difficult, but thanks to&nbsp;her parent’s encouragement, she managed to&nbsp;rise above every obstacle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da9/da8/ed9bec5865a5e2f48c24899c9a.jpg><p>At&nbsp;just 6&nbsp;months old, Hunt’s parents noticed something unusual about her. She was slow in&nbsp;developing her motor skills. Her mother took her to&nbsp;the hospital, and doctors said she had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>congenital hypothyroidism</a>. They predicted she would eventually need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;institution.</p><p>But instead of&nbsp;accepting this outlook, Linda’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother</a> decided to&nbsp;defy the odds. She started working with Linda every day to&nbsp;help her improve her motor skills. By&nbsp;the time she began <a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a>, Linda had made significant progress. However, she still stood out from her classmates and didn’t quite fit&nbsp;in. Right from her first day of&nbsp;school, she felt alone and different. One of&nbsp;her teachers made her feel uncomfortable. “Everybody either wanted to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;push me&nbsp;around, you know?” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;was teased a&nbsp;lot.”</p><p><h2>Linda feared that her condition would limit her acting opportunities.</h2></p><p>“I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;act at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age. I&nbsp;didn’t realize how difficult it&nbsp;is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be,” Hunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;newspaper interview back in&nbsp;1991. Her journey began at&nbsp;8&nbsp;when she watched a&nbsp;performance of&nbsp;Peter Pan on&nbsp;stage. It&nbsp;was then that she realized she wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same&nbsp;— to&nbsp;have the ability to&nbsp;make others believe in&nbsp;the stories she held in&nbsp;her mind. When she told her parents about her interest, they hired voice and acting teachers and enrolled her at&nbsp;the Goodman School of&nbsp;Drama in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>During her time there, her doctor made an&nbsp;unexpected discovery. She didn’t have congenital hypothyroidism as&nbsp;initially believed; instead, she had hypopituitary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dwarfism</a>. This condition means the pituitary gland doesn’t release enough growth hormone. She stood at&nbsp;4&nbsp;feet 9&nbsp;inches and weighed only 80&nbsp;pounds. For a&nbsp;decade, she tried various treatments and medicines to&nbsp;improve her condition, but unfortunately, none were successful.</p><p>While studying, her professors suggested that she pursue directing instead of&nbsp;acting. They believed that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>challenging</a> for her to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;stable <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress because of&nbsp;her condition.</p><p><h2>After graduating in&nbsp;her early 20s, Hunt moved to&nbsp;New York to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a56/233/63855a5a59b9a3b14ce347a3a4.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;was very young and very lost. I&nbsp;didn’t even attempt to&nbsp;act professionally. That would’ve meant getting an&nbsp;agent and going on&nbsp;auditions. I&nbsp;wasn’t capable of&nbsp;doing any of&nbsp;that. It&nbsp;was truly emotionally beyond&nbsp;me,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p>Luckily, Linda had many supportive friends who helped her out. She got a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stage manager at&nbsp;small theaters in&nbsp;the off-Broadway scene. However, even after working for three years, she didn’t make much impact and began doubting herself.</p><p>Later, she moved back to&nbsp;her parent’s house, and that’s when her life took a&nbsp;turn.</p><p><h2>Linda decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;doing what she loves&nbsp;— ACTING.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b09/9a6/fdd2135d6c90ec712edf5ccd9f.jpg><p>MGM/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>While living with her parents, Linda’s acting coach reminded her that acting was important to&nbsp;her and that it&nbsp;was her true <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talent</a>. She said, “I&nbsp;had lost myself for a&nbsp;while, and that awareness gave me&nbsp;back to&nbsp;myself.” Afterward, she audited for acting roles and sent out her acting portfolio.</p><p>Her first professional acting opportunity came with the play <i>Hamlet,</i> and over the next two years, she appeared in&nbsp;several more plays. Then, one day, Linda got a&nbsp;call from her agent. Her agent told her that director <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peter Weir</a> was searching for an&nbsp;actor to&nbsp;portray the character Billy Kwan in&nbsp;the movie <i>The Year of&nbsp;Living Dangerously</i>. Billy Kwan was a&nbsp;character who was a&nbsp;half-Asian male photographer with dwarfism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/02c/79a80c52b18d4131f27bc4d0db.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;met the casting director and said, ’You are going to&nbsp;rewrite the male part for a&nbsp;woman, right?’ And he&nbsp;said, ’No.’ I&nbsp;laughed. It&nbsp;was so&nbsp;wonderfully preposterous,” Linda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembered</a>.</p><p>However, after meeting with Peter, she understood she needed to&nbsp;accept the role. “It&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;those absurd moments in&nbsp;life when you have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;forward into a&nbsp;situation that makes no&nbsp;sense.” Although it&nbsp;may have seemed illogical at&nbsp;the time, this role allowed her talent to&nbsp;shine, and she became the first person to&nbsp;win an&nbsp;Oscar for playing a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character</a> of&nbsp;the opposite sex.</p><p><h2>But, even after winning an&nbsp;Academy Award, Linda’s life didn’t change, and it&nbsp;didn’t propel her to&nbsp;the top as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;she wanted.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/46b/ca0/7dc966557aacc985d2bb7e6927.jpg><p>While Linda Hunt found leading roles in&nbsp;theater, she had to&nbsp;settle for supporting roles in&nbsp;movies. She candidly shared, “I&nbsp;am working more than&nbsp;I thought I’d be. I&nbsp;am not working as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I’d like. I&nbsp;am still feeling enough frustration about my&nbsp;life and my&nbsp;career that I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;analysis now&nbsp;— but not forever. I&nbsp;go into moments of&nbsp;total despair and darkness. Thankfully, I&nbsp;believe there are always <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>answers</a>.”</p><p>Although her career didn’t take off as&nbsp;expected back then, she’s one of&nbsp;Hollywood’s most recognizable figures today. Over her career, she appeared in&nbsp;films like <i>Dune, Kindergarten Cop, and Dragonfly</i>. She also had a&nbsp;booming voice acting and television career, especially in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>, where she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>won</a> 2&nbsp;Teen Choice Awards.</p><p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>there is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;widespread speculation, that Linda’s appearance and character served to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>inspiration</a> for the popular character, Edna Mode from <i>The Incredibles</i>. However, others <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> that Edna was primarily based on&nbsp;costume designer Edith Head.</p><p>Talent is&nbsp;important, but nothing beats dedication.
