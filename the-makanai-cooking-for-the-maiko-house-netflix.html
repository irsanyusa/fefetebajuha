Two of his works earned awards at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival: a Jury Prize for <i>Like Father, Like Son </i>(2013), and the festival’s grand Palme d’Or prize for <i>Shoplifters </i>(2018)—which was also nominated at the 2019 Oscars and Golden Globes for Best Foreign Language Film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, he’s turning his focus to the small screen, as showrunner, writer, and director of the new Netflix series <i>The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House</i>, which premiered globally on Jan. 12 and is based on a popular manga in Japan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The nine-episode series tells the fictional modern-day story of 16-year-old Kiyo, a northern Japanese native who heads south to Kyoto to become a maiko, a young geiko—the Kyoto-specific term for geisha, Japanese traditional professional entertainers. The geiko mentors deem Kiyo unfit as a maiko due to her clumsiness, but she earns their hearts as the in-house cook, or the <i>makanai</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an interview with TIME, Kore-eda says he had little idea before making the show about the heavily-guarded culture of geiko and maiko, only having preconceived notions based on classical Japanese directors’ portrayals of the art performers in films.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When I researched the all-women, communal living quarters, known as <i>yakata</i>, in Kyoto, where this story takes place, I was fascinated by how the women call each other mothers and sisters despite having no blood relations,” Kore-eda says. “Their way of life inspired me to recreate this world for the screen.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><i>The Makanai</i> is a product of the manga moment</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thanks to the power of the internet in enabling increasingly global audiences to find content from around the world, manga (Japanese comics) has seen a rise in popularity among non-Japanese readers. <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Polygon</i></a> reports that sales of the top 50 manga titles in the U.S. tripled in 2021. And live-action adaptations are not a new phenomenon. South Korean director Park Chan-wook’s 2003 film <i>Oldboy </i>is loosely based on a Japanese manga of the same name by Garon Tsuchiya. <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i>, the 2014 Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt sci-fi action flick, <a href=# rel=noopener>was based on</a> the manga <i>All You Need Is Kill</i> by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Manga adaptations geared toward Western audiences, however, have proven to be hit-or-miss. Spike Lee’s 2013 <a href=#>remake</a> of Oldboy was <a href=# rel=noopener>a box-office flop</a>. Netflix’s 2017 live-action movie <i>Death Note </i>was almost <a href=# rel=noopener>universally</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>panned</a> by <a href=# rel=noopener>critics</a>. The 2017 blockbuster <i>Ghost In the Shell</i>, starring Scarlett Johansson, sparked controversy for <a href=#>white-washing</a>. And the 2009 adaptation of <i>Dragonball</i> is often listed among <a href=# rel=noopener>the worst films of the early 2000s</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>The Makanai </i>is based on a best-selling manga by Aiko Koyama entitled <i>Maiko-san chi no makanai-san</i>, first published in 2016. Koyama’s comic won one of Japan’s time-hallowed manga awards, the Shogakukan Manga Award, in 2020, and has sold over 2.7 million copies. Because of its domestic popularity, the manga already had an anime series adaptation, which aired on Japanese national broadcaster <a href=# rel=noopener>NHK World</a> in 2021.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Mass media’s problematic past depicting the lives of geisha</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The lives of Japan’s locally-revered artisans are shrouded in secrecy. Geiko and maiko as occupations date back to the 1600s. But the geisha population, some <a href=# rel=noopener>80,000</a> in the 1920s, is now on the decline, even more so after the <a href=# rel=noopener>COVID-19 pandemic hit</a>. There are estimated to be fewer than 1,000 geisha in Japan today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1997, the world had a rarefied window into geisha life through <i>Sayuri: Memoirs of a Geisha</i>, an English novel by Arthur Golden, which eventually became a 2005 major motion picture by Rob Marshall that controversially starred non-Japanese women in Japanese roles. But the source material itself stirred controversy, too: retired geiko Mineko Iwasaki, whom Golden interviewed to write the novel, filed a suit against him and his publisher for supposedly breaking the code of silence about her community. The two eventually settled out of court.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If there was anything Mineko <a href=# rel=noopener>lamented</a> most, it was the novel’s highly-sexualized depiction of geiko. For years, Western media have conflated geisha activity with dalliance and highly-stylized prostitution. Following the success of Golden’s novel, tourists fled to geisha districts in Japan, book in hand, wanting to catch a glimpse of the women. Soon, geiko in Kyoto’s Gion reported instances of harassment from tourists who wanted pictures (among other cultural taboos), prompting the district to enforce a ban on <a href=# rel=noopener>taking photographs</a> in 2019.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kore-eda is aware of the past controversy and hopes that his series will do better, though he also hopes that people don’t confuse fiction for reality “once again,” he says. There are no teenage makanai, like the character Kiyo, for example. “I heard that due to the influence of <i>Sayuri: Memoirs of a Geisha</i>, many tourists from overseas misunderstood that all maiko have been sold by their parents,” Kore-eda tells TIME. “Perhaps this series will at least dispel such misconceptions, although I never intended on it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>The Makanai</i> humanizes geisha culture mostly through Sumire, Kiyo’s best friend who trains to be a “one-in-a-million” maiko, and her other housemates, illustrating the effort and work required to be a maiko, the practices and rules and even superstitions they follow—down to the use of phones and lucky charms, while also shining light on the relatable aspects of their lives like having crushes, maintaining friendships, and navigating romantic relationships.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><i>The Makanai</i> is ultimately a story about food</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As a story about the house makanai—which means both the cook and the meal served in a boarding house—Kore-eda’s team indulged in detailed food scenes. Food is a grounding device in many of the director’s films, often used to propel narratives about family. His 2008 feature <i>Still Walking</i> begins with a mother and daughter preparing vegetables together. In a cramped shanty in <i>Shoplifters</i>, a motley band of thieves share dinner cooked from stolen groceries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The other directors working with Kore-eda on the show see it as a celebration of Japan’s food culture. Audiences will be treated to Kiyo’s excitement over produce, and her joy after seeing people react to food she prepared. Fellow director Takuma Sato says the series is also a reflection of the wisdom of finding joy in the change of food, clothes, and seasons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hiroshi Okuyama, another director of the series, had read the manga source material and had found it influencing his own cooking. “I was trying to imitate Kiyo’s cooking and choosing the better quality ingredients,” Hiroshi tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Both Hiroshi and Takuma hope whoever watches <i>Makanai</i> will enjoy how food in Japan is treated. Says Takuma: “I would be happy if the audience would pay attention to the aspects of eating that can excite and relax people, and inspire them to think what to cook or what to eat.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Correction, Jan. 13</b><br><i>The original version of this article misspelled two names</i><i>.
