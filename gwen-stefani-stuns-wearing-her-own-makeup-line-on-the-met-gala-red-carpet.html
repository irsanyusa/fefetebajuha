She turned heads in a beautiful Vera Wang two piece neon dress with flower accents. The floor length dress exposed the singers shoulders while still featuring long sleeves.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gwen-stefani-does-her-own-makeup-for-the-2022-met-gala>Gwen Stefani Does Her Own Makeup for The 2022 Met Gala</h2><p>Stefani was definitely ready for her close up last night! Everything about this look was absolute perfection for the singer. Her hair was perfectly straight and her makeup was simple, yet flattering. While on the red carpet, Stefani revealed that she had done her own makeup for the event.</p><p>“Honestly I had a crazy day because I was supposed to work with a new makeup artist and we did a test together and we were all excited about it,” Stefani <a href=#>said</a>. “She had an emergency, she had to leave, so I had to do my own makeup.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>While most other celebrities on the red carpet had professional teams behind them, Stefani created this look on her own using her own line. Some of her products came from her own line <a href=#>GXVE</a>. Stefani used her line’s waterproof gel liner to create her cat eye, along with two unreleased lipstick colors to create her nude lip. On her skin she used GXVE’s primer and also filled in her eyebrows with their eyebrow pencil. Her blush, highlighter, and bronzer have not been specified since they are on the lighter side.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vera Wang Designed the Iconic Neon Look</h2><p>Stefani appeared at the Met Gala alongside her wedding dress designer, Vera Wang. The singer noted that since Wang had created her iconic wedding look, she wanted to celebrate it again by appearing in Wang’s style on the red carpet.</p><p>When it came to this event, Stefani noted that her stylist originally had other things in mind, but eventually came up with the neon look. This year’s Met Gala theme was gilded glamor. While there were many interpretations seen on the red carpet nodding toward the 1870 to 1890 time period, Stefani’s approach to the theme was unique. The singer expressed that her look embodies happiness, which is part of the reason she chose to wear it.</p><p>I personally think Stefani nailed the glamor aspect of the theme, but fell flat in the gilded category. Even though she wasn’t the leading example of the theme, I still really loved this look on her. <a href=#>Once again</a> she managed to pull off a neon look better than anyone could have imagined.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Website-Thumbnail-17-1.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Judges Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj Share Cute Moment at the Met Gala" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Gwen Stefani</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xrCcp2WjqbKnrc2iZKyspaPAbsPEmqmippditaa%2BjKiup2Wdlrimwc9mo6KmlWK8r3nToZxmpZWpeqity5pkq52UYrCivs%2Beq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
