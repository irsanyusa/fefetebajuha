Spears’ ex-husband Kevin Federline has spoken out about how Spears’ social media posts have affected her sons.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-britney-spears-posts-nude-photo-on-twitter>Britney Spears Posts Nude Photo on Twitter</h2><p>On Tuesday night, Spears shared a photo on Twitter in which she lies nude on a bed, covering her breast with her hand. She wrote in the caption, “I have a premiere for a movie this week ‘THE LEGISLATIVE ACT OF MY P*SSY’ !!!!”</p><p>As of this writing, the post has over 20,000 retweets and nearly 300,000 likes. Reactions to the photo in the replies were mixed. Some people disapproved of Spears posting nude pictures as a mother, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one writing</a>, “You have sons. Think about them before you post.”</p><p>Others defended the star, with one user writing, “Y’all haters need to stop with the hate already. Britney is fine. If she wants to show off what god gave her that’s her business. Don’t like it? Unfollow and block her. It’s that simple.”</p><p>Spears didn’t post the photo to Instagram. Although her account is back now, she deleted it last week. The star previously deleted her account in August. Earlier this month, Spears posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">photos of herself</a> posing nude on a beach, with hearts added to cover her up.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ELTON JOHN, BRITNEY SPEARS’ ‘HOLD ME CLOSER’ IS A VIBRANTLY EMOTIONAL MUST-WATCH</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/britneyspears/status/1582529873603534850</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kevin-federline-has-spoken-out-about-her-nude-photos>Kevin Federline Has Spoken Out About Her Nude Photos</h3><p>In August, Spears’ ex-husband Kevin Federline spoke publicly about the star, claiming their two sons don’t want to see her and chose not to attend her wedding to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new husband Sam Asghari</a> earlier this year. Spears’ habit of posting nude photos apparently contributed to the rift.</p><p>“I try to explain to them, ‘Look, maybe that’s just another way she tries to express herself,’” Federline told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daily Mail</a>. “But that doesn’t take away from the fact of what it does to them. It’s tough. I can’t imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.”</p><p>Last year, Spears’ 13-year conservatorship was ended, after years of fans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">demanding Free Britney</a>. However, Federline said he believes her father Jamie Spears “saved her life” by being her conservator.</p><p>Spears and Federline were married from 2004 to 2007. They share two sons, 17-year-old Sean Preston and 16-year-old Jayden James. Federline has been married to volleyball player Victoria Prince since 2014.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_TerryCrews_KristySellars_Trae-PattonNBC.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Runner-Up Kristy Sellars Launches Pole Training App" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>britney spears</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waugraaVrnq0vMSaqaxloKTAtb%2BMp6ydnV2ltbDAzmamp2WkrLa1wMSrZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZpuirpmZsqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
