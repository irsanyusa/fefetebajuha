The next season of the series’s TV spin-off, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series is coming. Fans theorize that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanessa Hudgens</a> and Zac Efron will return to East High.</strong></p><p>The upcoming season of HSMTMTS will follow the students as they put on a musical of High School Musical 3: Senior Year. Apparently, the season will follow characters as they return to East High for their senior year, but they find out that the school is being used to film High School Musical 4: The Reunion movie.</p><p>Since there’s mention of a “reunion” fans are dying to know if Hudgens and Efron will reprise their roles of Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton. Although there has been no confirmations at the moment, here’s why we think Hudgens and Efron will be apart of the reunion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-gabriella-montez-zac-efron-return-to-east-high>Will Gabriella Montez, Zac Efron Return to East High?</h2><p>Since the upcoming series of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HSMTMTS</a> was teased, the network released which trilogy characters will make an appearance. Although the original released cast was Monique Coleman (Taylor McKessie), Bart Johnson (Mr. Bolton), and Alyson Reed (Ms. Darbus). Ahead of this confirmation, KayCee Stroh (Martha Cox), Lucas Grabeel (Ryan Evans) and Corbin Bleu (Chad Danforth) had previously appeared on other seasons.</p><p>In July 2022, Efron posted a photo of him in front of the iconic HSM school. Even though this normally would mean nothing, Hudgens had posted a very very similar photo, months ahead. Earlier in 2022, Efron also admitted that he would reprise his role as Bolton, if given the opportunity.</p><p>“Seriously, having the opportunity in any form to go back and work with that team would be so amazing. My heart’s still there,” Efron <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “That would be incredible. I hope it happens.”</p><p>Later in the year, Hudgens reunited with other cast members Grabeel, Bleu, and Johnson, as well as the trilogy’s director Kenny Ortega. They all appeared at Dream It Conventions in Paris in November 2022. it’s important to note that every person on that panel, except Hudgens, has reprised their role. That within itself may be confirmation.</p><p>At one point, fans were excited to see Hudgens and Efron listed as cast members on the show when googled. Even though many knew this was probably false, they still got excited. Soon after news broke, Google updated their query, so their names no longer appeared when searching the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Zac Efron Follows Vanessa Hudgens on Instagram Nearly a Decade After Split</h2><p>Recently, news broke that Efron followed Hudgens on Instagram. For fans that may not know the tea, they started dating in 2007 and broke up in 2010. In 2014, Efron admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that he and Hudgens were no longer in contact.</p><p>Since many young fans of High School Musical grew up with the actors on their screen, many quickly tokened their relationship as “ideal.” Many young fans were upset when they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">split</a>.</p><p>Now, more than a decade later, they are connected once more. Although Hudgens has not followed Efron back at the time of writing, this could be a huge hint about the upcoming season of HSMTMTS. It’s possible that the two are working, or have worked on the series together.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Zac Efron has followed Vanessa Hudgens on Instagram. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5vLAocONY4</a></p>— Pop Tingz (@ThePopTingz) <a href=#>April 17, 2023</a><p>As a longtime fan of High School Musical, I really hope to see Hudgens and Efron in HSMTMTS season four.
