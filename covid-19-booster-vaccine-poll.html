The answer may determine how severe any potential surges may be.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A new Morning Consult and Politico survey found that 57% of U.S. registered voters said they plan to get a new COVID-19 booster sometime this year, including 37% who said they “definitely” plan to receive it. Meanwhile, 43% of voters said they would not get a new booster vaccine, with 27% saying they “definitely” do not plan to get one.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As we’ve now seen for the past several years, there is a stark partisan divide around COVID-19 vaccines: Democrats were much more likely to say they plan to get the new boosters than Republicans and independents.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Food and Drug Administration on Monday <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>approved</a> Pfizer’s and Moderna’s new COVID-19 booster vaccines, which were developed to target more recent strains of the virus. On the following day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>recommended</a> that anyone 6 months or older get a new booster.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The recommendations for the new shots also mean that people who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 can get the latest versions without receiving the two-shot primary series. The simplified approach mirrors the United States’ strategy used for influenza vaccines and is, in part, intended to entice people who are unvaccinated against COVID-19 to get vaccinated.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">However, the new strategy is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>unlikely to sway</a> unvaccinated people, who appear to be dug into their stance. In Morning Consult and Politico’s latest survey, just 9% of unvaccinated voters said they plan to get a new booster.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Similar shares of voters said their children would get COVID-19 boosters this year</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There were similar results for voters who said whether or not they plan for their children to get the latest boosters, but shares were down a bit for nearly every group. Among all voters, 53% said they plan for their children to get boosted sometime this year, compared with 47% who said the opposite.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There was also a similar partisan divide, with Democrats still more likely to say they plan for their children to get the new booster shots than Republicans or independents. Interestingly, 42% of Republicans said they plan for their children to get boosted this year, which is 3 percentage points higher than the share who said they plan to get one for themselves.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The federal government’s and drugmakers’ strategies for rolling out the vaccines and messaging campaigns could be crucial to get vaccination rates up, as there is still a question about whether people who say they plan to get vaccinated actually do. The shares of people who said they plan to get boosters in past Morning Consult <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>surveys</a> have been quite lower than <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>vaccination rates</a> tracked by the CDC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5i8t7XDZmhyZZKkvLTAxKtkr5mTmLavsYyppqWk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
