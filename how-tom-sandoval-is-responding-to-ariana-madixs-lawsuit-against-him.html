Madix filed the lawsuit in January, requesting they sell their Los Angeles home and split the profits.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-sandoval-pushes-back-against-ariana-madix-s-lawsuit>Tom Sandoval Pushes Back Against Ariana Madix’s Lawsuit</h2><p>According to court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, Sandoval claims that Madix “fails to state sufficient facts to state a cause of action” against him. He also says she did not act “reasonably and in good faith”&nbsp;when filing the lawsuit.</p><p>Sandoval reportedly does not think a partition of their Los Angeles home should be granted, but if it is, he says that he should “receive an accounting and compensatory adjustments” for changes he apparently made to the house which “enhance the value.”</p><p>The former couple purchased the property in the Valley Village neighborhood in 2019 for over $2 million. Madix and Sandoval split last year after nine years together, following a cheating scandal involving Sandoval and their Vanderpump Rules co-star Rachel Leviss.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ARIANA MADIX GUSHES ABOUT NEW BOYFRIEND AS TOM SANDOVAL OPENS UP ABOUT AFFAIR</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-was-living-together-post-breakup>The Couple Was Living Together Post-Breakup</h2><p>Shortly after breaking up last year, the former couple was apparently still living together in their shared San Fernando Valley home. A representative for Sandoval explained the complicated situation in March of 2023.</p><p>“They own the house together, and what happens next with the property will take time to sort out,” the rep told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time. “This isn’t something that’s going to be decided in a weekend.”</p><p>Madix has since moved on in a new relationship with fitness instructor Daniel Wai. She also reached the Finals of Dancing with the Stars Season 32 last year, and she’s currently starring in a production of Chicago on Broadway.</p><p>The new season of Vanderpump Rules, once again featuring both Madix and Sandoval, is currently airing Tuesday nights on Bravo.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NUP_194863_00783.jpg alt="Ariana Grande Auditioned for ‘Wicked’ While Coaching on ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ariana madix</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Tom Sandoval</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZqyfonq0rc2dpq%2BZnGK2tHnRnqqpp56Ztq%2BzjK2mZpminq6vrYymmJ2hqKh6ra3WrKyirF2WtKK1zayrZqCZonw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
