Though the line would go&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;parodied countless times, it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>landed</a> at #100&nbsp;on the American Film Institute’s list of&nbsp;the greatest movie quotes.</li><li><strong>No&nbsp;acting Oscars were won</strong>: Although <i>Titanic</i> won 11&nbsp;Oscars, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>none</a> of&nbsp;them were for acting. The only actor who was nominated was 87-year-old Gloria Stuart (Old Rose), who lost to&nbsp;Kim Basinger for <i>L.A. Confidential</i>. Kate Winslet was nominated for Best Actress but lost to&nbsp;Helen Hunt for <i>As&nbsp;Good as&nbsp;It&nbsp;Gets</i>. It&nbsp;took Winslet another five nominations before she brought home a&nbsp;statue (for <i>The Reader </i>in&nbsp;2009).</li><li><strong>Kate Winslet learned she got the part while wearing a&nbsp;straitjacket: </strong>The day Winslet learned she had landed her star-making role, she was in&nbsp;England filming <i>Hamlet </i>with Kenneth Branagh. After getting off the phone with her agent, she then went to&nbsp;work, which meant wearing a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>straitjacket</a> to&nbsp;film Ophelia’s famous breakdown scene.</li><li><strong>A&nbsp;drawing of&nbsp;a&nbsp;naked Kate Winslet sold for thousands: </strong>One of&nbsp;the most memorable scenes in&nbsp;the movie is&nbsp;when Jack draws Rose, who is&nbsp;wearing nothing but the Heart of&nbsp;the Ocean necklace. The drawing was done by&nbsp;Cameron, not DiCaprio. In&nbsp;2011, a&nbsp;company called Premiere Props auctioned off one of&nbsp;the movie’s most iconic pieces of&nbsp;memorabilia: the drawing itself. Although the identity of&nbsp;the buyer and the final price were not released publicly, the highest known bid was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$16,000</a>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/071/e77/bc6216532f9dd07f1cbdd39576.png><ul><li><strong>The freezing water wasn’t cold at&nbsp;all: </strong>Cameron admitted that the seven-month shoot was pretty intense, but he&nbsp;insists that the soggy scenes weren’t as&nbsp;tough on&nbsp;the actors as&nbsp;they might seem on&nbsp;screen. According to&nbsp;him, the water in&nbsp;the tank was like a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cozy 80-degree pool</a>, and all that dramatic cold breath you see was just added in&nbsp;post-production. As&nbsp;for those rumors about Cameron’s stars being stuck in&nbsp;the water tank for hours without bathroom breaks, he&nbsp;just brushed it&nbsp;off with a&nbsp;laugh, saying “Everyone could go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the toilet, but they were encouraged not to&nbsp;go&nbsp;in&nbsp;the tank&nbsp;— which&nbsp;I think was happening!”</li><li><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio almost passed on&nbsp;the role:</strong> According to&nbsp;director James Cameron, DiCaprio was initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reluctant</a> to&nbsp;audition for the part, and had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;persuaded by&nbsp;the filmmaker. Cameron pointed out that in&nbsp;his audition, DiCaprio, “charmed everybody, myself included.” Nevertheless, when he&nbsp;arranged a&nbsp;chemistry read for the actor with his future co-star Winslet, Cameron remembers feeling uncertain.<br>“He&nbsp;said, ‘You mean I’m reading?’” Cameron said. “And I&nbsp;said yeah, he&nbsp;said, ‘Oh, I&nbsp;don’t read’. I&nbsp;said, ‘Well,’ I&nbsp;shook his hand, I&nbsp;said, ‘Thanks for coming by.’ And he&nbsp;said, ‘Wait, you mean if&nbsp;I don’t read, I&nbsp;don’t get the part? Just like that?’” “I&nbsp;said, ‘Oh yeah, come&nbsp;on, this is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;giant movie that’s going to&nbsp;take two years of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, and you’ll be&nbsp;gone doing five other things while I’m doing post-production and all the model work and everything, so&nbsp;I’m not gonna ruin it&nbsp;up&nbsp;by&nbsp;making the wrong decision in&nbsp;casting, so&nbsp;you’re gonna read, or&nbsp;you’re not gonna get the part,’” Cameron remembered that DiCaprio did read, although the director observed a&nbsp;sulky demeanor.<br>“He&nbsp;comes in&nbsp;and like every ounce of&nbsp;his entire being is&nbsp;just so&nbsp;negative, right up&nbsp;until&nbsp;I said action, and then he&nbsp;turned into Jack and Kate just lit&nbsp;up, and they went into this whole thing and played the scene,” Cameron shared. “Dark clouds had opened up&nbsp;and a&nbsp;ray of&nbsp;sun came down and lit up&nbsp;Jack. I’m like, alright, he’s the guy.”</li><li><strong>Kate Winslet hated her performance: </strong>Winslet revealed that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hated her American accent</a> and her acting in&nbsp;the film. “I’m like, ‘Really, really? You did it&nbsp;like that? Oh&nbsp;my&nbsp;God.’ My&nbsp;American accent, I&nbsp;can’t listen to&nbsp;it. It’s awful,” she said.<i> </i>She also felt mocked by&nbsp;the media and the public for her physique, which did not fit the conventional standards of&nbsp;beauty. Winslet said that she had a&nbsp;hard time watching the film and wished she could do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again with the skills she had gained over the years.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2ef/d91/aa8a7f5625ad6a080e3e1dd331.png><ul><li><strong>Kate Winslet shared a&nbsp;shaving mishap that occurred during the shoot. </strong>In&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scene</a> where Rose is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;jumping ship, Winslet explained, “There’s a&nbsp;bit where Leo takes my&nbsp;hand, and because of&nbsp;the way Jim was lighting this particular shot, the light was catching all the little hairs on&nbsp;my&nbsp;arm.” Winslet continued, “He&nbsp;was like, ’Okay, we’re going to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;shave your arm.’ So&nbsp;we&nbsp;stop filming, and the makeup artist has a&nbsp;Bic razor and some Gillette shaving foam. It&nbsp;was hilarious.

They get a&nbsp;brief, unidentified cameo in&nbsp;the film as&nbsp;the elderly couple lying in&nbsp;bed together as&nbsp;the water washes over them.<br>Their love story is&nbsp;as&nbsp;touching as&nbsp;Jack’s and Rose’s. They were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> for 40&nbsp;years and witnesses say that they were allowed on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifeboat because of&nbsp;their age, but Isidor refused to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;before every woman and child left the ship. His wife decided to&nbsp;stay with her husband, and they were last seen on&nbsp;the boat deck sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;deck chairs holding hands until they both perished.</li><li><strong>Jack didn’t have to&nbsp;die</strong>: One question that has plagued Cameron since <i>Titanic</i> came out&nbsp;is: Did Jack really have to&nbsp;die? In&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>MythBusters</i></a> that examined whether both Jack and Rose could have stayed on&nbsp;the wooden beam without it&nbsp;sinking, Cameron himself came on&nbsp;the show to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admit</a> that the movie’s dramatic ending depended on&nbsp;Jack dying. “Things happen for artistic reasons, not for physics reasons,” quipped Cameron.<br>In&nbsp;2016, Cameron was still being grilled about&nbsp;it. Though he&nbsp;repeated that the decision to&nbsp;kill Jack was “an&nbsp;artistic choice,” he&nbsp;also defended the scene by&nbsp;saying that he&nbsp;had tested the floating board prop itself to&nbsp;gauge its buoyancy.</li></ul><p>Experience the joyous exploration of&nbsp;<a href=#>20&nbsp;minor mistakes</a> in&nbsp;the legendary movie that true fans have spotted.
