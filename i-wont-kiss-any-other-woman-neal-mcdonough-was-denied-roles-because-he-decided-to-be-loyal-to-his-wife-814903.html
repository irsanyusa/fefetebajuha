That’s because they’re acting out romantic scenes for the camera. But there’s one actor, Neal McDonough, who is&nbsp;different. He&nbsp;was willing to&nbsp;risk his career rather than kiss any woman other than his wife. Let’s find out why.</p><p><h2>Before he&nbsp;found Ruvé.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/954/d53/fca3dc5a8fbbc49c5fe2de816a.jpg><p>Being the youngest of&nbsp;six kids, Neal always loved making his older brothers and sisters laugh. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a>, “I&nbsp;was the school’s prankster and the center of&nbsp;attention.” Even though he&nbsp;struggled with dyslexia and found <a href=# title=math data-link=tag>math</a> and reading hard, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;real talent for making people giggle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a6c/f13/7450da5ceeb19df1e0a6eb0d82.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b7/a65/2b10985f028745672a6a94758d.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/372/43a/65777356fb9ff4f876e7a52f59.jpg><p>Also, people really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>liked</a> his well-known role as&nbsp;the bad guy Damien Darhk in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV show <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Arrow</i></a>. In&nbsp;that show, he&nbsp;played a&nbsp;character with magical abilities, but it&nbsp;showed that deep down, he’s a&nbsp;good person in&nbsp;real life.</p><p>Before he&nbsp;met his wife, he&nbsp;was thinking about stopping his career in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. He&nbsp;planned to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;Cape Cod, work at&nbsp;his parents’ motel, and be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;local theater. But then something changed when he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;call from <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg" data-link=tag>Steven Spielberg</a>. Spielberg wanted him to&nbsp;audition for a&nbsp;show called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Band of&nbsp;Brothers</i></a>, which changed everything.</p><p><h2>Neal McDonough and his other half.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f2e/7b8/4e2b9757d4be378ab7475a3ac7.png><p>In&nbsp;the year 2000, while Neal was working on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Band of&nbsp;Brothers</i></a>, he&nbsp;and his future wife Ruvé <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>crossed</a> paths unexpectedly. He&nbsp;shares that he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with Ruvé the first time he&nbsp;saw her. Furthermore, he&nbsp;mentions that they bumped into each other on&nbsp;St. Patrick’s Day while he&nbsp;was interviewed in&nbsp;2004.</p><p>Likewise, he&nbsp;mentioned that when he&nbsp;first saw her, he&nbsp;unintentionally said, “You’re tall.” At&nbsp;that time, he&nbsp;was already dating someone else. But after meeting Ruvé, he&nbsp;called his then-girlfriend and said, “I’m sorry, but it’s not going to&nbsp;work out between&nbsp;us anymore. I&nbsp;just met the woman I’m going to&nbsp;marry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b6a/f6f/a5491e561e825a596854ee51d8.jpeg><p>Ruvé and Neal tied the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>knot</a> on&nbsp;December&nbsp;1, 2003, which was 3&nbsp;years after they first met. Their wedding was lovely, and their honeymoon was filled with joy. They traveled to&nbsp;places like Cape Cod, London, South Africa, Santa Barbara, and more for over seven weeks.</p><p>Even today, Neal continues to&nbsp;show his deep affection for his wife through his posts on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>. On&nbsp;their 13th wedding anniversary, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> a&nbsp;heartfelt message describing Ruvé as&nbsp;his best friend, love, and life partner. He&nbsp;expressed his gratitude for having the best thing happen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df6/93d/3fa2e25ea1af97b366a4541842.jpg><p>The McDonoughs have reached 20&nbsp;years of&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> and are still happily living with their 2&nbsp;boys and 3&nbsp;girls. Their first child was Morgan Patrick McDonough, and their second was Catherine Maggie McDonough. After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years, their third child was born, a&nbsp;daughter named London Jane McDonough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e7c/3db/2b72e6584d95855dcf7b8ac6fe.jpeg><p>After that, they welcomed their daughter, Clover Elizabeth McDonough, and later, their youngest child, James Hamilton McDonough, joined the family. So&nbsp;now, their family of&nbsp;7&nbsp;lives happily together in&nbsp;Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a1/750/b6881657a5b4a9fa4966ce368f.jpg><p><h2>He&nbsp;only wants to&nbsp;kiss his wife.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac7/93d/a94b6456ce9524b986bd3d5561.jpg><p>On&nbsp;his journey to&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;actor, Neal McDonough clearly stated that his faith is&nbsp;his top priority. Throughout his 30-year career, he&nbsp;has never participated in&nbsp;intimate scenes. Even after being married for a&nbsp;long time and having five children, he&nbsp;still loves his wife more than anyone else. He&nbsp;once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “I&nbsp;won’t kiss any other woman because these lips are only for one woman.”</p><p>Certain individuals in&nbsp;Hollywood have been understanding and respectful of&nbsp;his beliefs. For instance, there was a&nbsp;time when he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;role on&nbsp;a&nbsp;show that contained a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;content he&nbsp;couldn’t agree with. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>, “When Marc Cherry signed&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;told him, ’You probably already know this, but&nbsp;I won’t kiss anyone.’” He&nbsp;remembered explaining to&nbsp;the show’s creator that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Christian. “’But this is&nbsp;Desperate Housewives!’ Cherry said. I&nbsp;told him, ’I know.’ He&nbsp;waited for a&nbsp;few seconds and then responded, ’Okay, I’ll just have to&nbsp;write better.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e85/78d/a643765728af6c29d4103c7617.jpg><p>McDonough <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that his decision to&nbsp;avoid “love scenes” had consequences. In&nbsp;2010, he&nbsp;turned down a&nbsp;role on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ABC show because it&nbsp;involved intimate scenes with an&nbsp;actress, and he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;stay faithful to&nbsp;his wife. This choice supposedly cost him around $1&nbsp;million, according to&nbsp;reports.</p><p>This turn of&nbsp;events was surprising and challenging for him. Following that incident, he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;find new opportunities because he&nbsp;stuck to&nbsp;his stance on&nbsp;not participating in&nbsp;such scenes. He&nbsp;mentioned, “I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;faith.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89e/e04/25b3985c4c83541f7269499e55.jpg><p>He&nbsp;felt confident that he&nbsp;had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chosen</a> correctly by&nbsp;trusting both himself and his wife, the woman he&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with from the moment he&nbsp;saw her. He&nbsp;said, “I’m the luckiest guy&nbsp;I know to&nbsp;have her as&nbsp;my&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;everything after five kids and a&nbsp;great life.”</p><p>While Neal encountered challenges, his career has since been remarkable. His face is&nbsp;recognizable, even if&nbsp;not everyone can recall his name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00d/c65/e0376f5b3ea88b993e131190a5.jpg><p>Recently, the couple joyfully celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary. They reaffirmed their wedding promises to&nbsp;each other. Neil was dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;handsome suit, while Ruvé wore a&nbsp;wedding gown, just like she did many years ago. Sharing a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>photo</a> of&nbsp;this moment on&nbsp;social media, the actor once again expressed that asking her to&nbsp;marry him was his most wonderful choice.</p><p>Neal McDonough stands out as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most kind-hearted fathers with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>multiple</a> children in&nbsp;Hollywood. Like many of&nbsp;his peers, he&nbsp;discovered his serene happiness with an&nbsp;ordinary woman who, in&nbsp;his eyes, was more beautiful than any actress he&nbsp;had ever known. And when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;not kissing on-screen, this isn’t the most unusual challenge directors encounter.</p><p>Another actor who didn’t hesitate to&nbsp;leave a&nbsp;project to&nbsp;protect his relationship with his wife was Patrick Dempsey.
