It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;not so&nbsp;unique: a&nbsp;husband in&nbsp;his late 40s leaving a&nbsp;wife of&nbsp;many years for someone who’s young and “fresh”. But the woman found a&nbsp;very witty way to&nbsp;show her husband and his young mistress that she’s not the person who’ll cry day and night, and she also has something up&nbsp;her sleeve to&nbsp;make them feel very uncomfortable.</p><p><h2>Family life for the spouses has not always been a&nbsp;bed of&nbsp;roses.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02f/fba/874de85f63ae1713a95653bf3c.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.</p><p>𝐰𝐰𝐰.Richnow05</p><p>A&nbsp;woman named Sandra, 45, wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter where she told&nbsp;us her absolutely mind-blowing family situation. She opened her letter with some backstory, saying that she and her husband Matt had been happily married for 25&nbsp;years before an&nbsp;unwanted affair ruined their union.</p><p>Sandra wrote, “Our life with Matt had been happy, and&nbsp;I felt really <a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> throughout these 25&nbsp;years. I&nbsp;would call this <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> blessed, because we&nbsp;both have been through so&nbsp;many ups and downs, including a&nbsp;tragic accident that happened in&nbsp;our family and took the life of&nbsp;our youngest son, Luca.”</p><p>Sandra recalls that all pain and all troubles that she and Matt faced during their family life, were met by&nbsp;both of&nbsp;them unanimously, and they coped with everything together. Sandra also wrote, “I&nbsp;could never have suspected that Matt could cheat on&nbsp;me. In&nbsp;our younger years, he&nbsp;didn’t pay much attention to&nbsp;other ladies, it&nbsp;was only me&nbsp;who was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;spotlight for him, and this didn’t seem to&nbsp;have changed throughout the years. Matt has always been a&nbsp;totally monogamous man, who would do&nbsp;anything and everything for his family to&nbsp;live a&nbsp;calm and happy life.”</p><p>Who could have thought that an&nbsp;absolute treasure of&nbsp;a&nbsp;spouse would have an&nbsp;affair!</p><p><h2>One day turned everything upside down in&nbsp;Sandra’s quiet and settled life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e40/3c7/5cb3e45a8bbb5511f240410e5a.jpg><p>Sandra goes&nbsp;on, saying, “One day, Matt came home from work earlier than usually. I&nbsp;became instantly worried, because&nbsp;I knew he&nbsp;had some problems with his heart lately, so&nbsp;I supposed he&nbsp;was having some heartache, and he&nbsp;was looking exhausted, which made me&nbsp;even more worried about him.”</p><p>When she asked Matt about what was happening and how he&nbsp;was feeling, he&nbsp;asked her to&nbsp;sit down with him and listen. Apparently, he&nbsp;had something serious to&nbsp;share with his wife, so&nbsp;she prepared for some bad news, but she couldn’t even expect it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;that bad.</p><p>Sandra wrote, “Matt sat on&nbsp;the opposite side of&nbsp;the table and started talking. He&nbsp;put it&nbsp;straight without rambling, that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;mistress, her name’s Abby, she’s 25, and she’s his ex-coworker.”</p><p>Sandra was shocked at&nbsp;the news, but her astonishment grew even more when Matt announced that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> Sandra immediately and marry Abby. He&nbsp;also mentioned that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;spend all his retirement allowance on&nbsp;Abby and her needs, because she would be&nbsp;his spouse soon.</p><p><h2>Sandra didn’t deliver the reaction that her spouse was expecting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00b/80b/f6afa85c07adf8120a7ca796e2.jpg><p>Sandra wrote, “I&nbsp;don’t know exactly what people do&nbsp;in&nbsp;such cases as&nbsp;mine, if&nbsp;they laugh, cry, become depressed, whatever. But at&nbsp;that moment&nbsp;I just said to&nbsp;myself that&nbsp;I shouldn’t do&nbsp;any of&nbsp;these things. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;calm as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock, and didn’t even ask him for any details. I&nbsp;suggested discussing the divorce together and finished the talk after we&nbsp;did.”</p><p>Sandra and Matt got divorced in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time, and Matt got married to&nbsp;Abby. They went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;honeymoon. And Sandra found out from Matt’s Instagram page that they went exactly to&nbsp;the same place where she and Matt used to&nbsp;stay when they were newlyweds.</p><p>This made her fuming, she confessed that this was the last straw, and she didn’t expect her ex&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;cynical.</p><p><h2>When the newlyweds returned from their trip, a&nbsp;big surprise was waiting for them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64b/862/a3006e5ed4abe9eff471610ad1.jpg><p>Sandra goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying that she knew the exact date and time her ex&nbsp;and his mistress would come back from their honeymoon. Matt called her and said that they would come to&nbsp;their house, which they co-owned with Sandra, to&nbsp;discuss this very house together.</p><p>Sandra knew what this all would be&nbsp;about. She knew that Matt would be&nbsp;urging her to&nbsp;sell the house and to&nbsp;leave&nbsp;it. But she also knew that she would never let it&nbsp;happen, as&nbsp;she already had a&nbsp;plan.</p><p>So, when Matt and Abby arrived, they rang the doorbell, and when the door was open, the first thing they saw was red tape. It&nbsp;was everywhere in&nbsp;the house, arranged in&nbsp;some logical way that could be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;border between the rooms.</p><p>Sandra wrote, “They asked me&nbsp;immediately what it&nbsp;all was about. I&nbsp;asked them not to&nbsp;cross the red tape here and there and explained that now, we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;living in&nbsp;this house together, so&nbsp;I made a&nbsp;border, between their part and mine, and&nbsp;I divided everything into two parts. The bathroom, the kitchen, our bedrooms, even the closet. I&nbsp;said they shouldn’t cross the red tape, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;violation of&nbsp;private property, and if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;cross&nbsp;it, they need to&nbsp;ask me&nbsp;first, every time they want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>Sandra added some more explanation to&nbsp;the newlyweds, and they became even more shocked.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aaa/c82/746a4a544d938b0d8a1e791132.jpg><p>Sandra explained that she divided the kitchen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that the fridge is&nbsp;on&nbsp;“her” side, as&nbsp;they’re the newlyweds and they will buy themselves a&nbsp;new one. She also divided the only one sink with water, and she made it&nbsp;from bottom to&nbsp;half. As&nbsp;for the bathroom, they had two, so&nbsp;she allowed them to&nbsp;use the one which was upstairs, and hers was downstairs. The one that she left for the newlyweds, needed a&nbsp;big repair, and she said they could use their finance to&nbsp;renovate&nbsp;it.</p><p>Saying that the couple was in&nbsp;shock is&nbsp;to&nbsp;say nothing, as&nbsp;Sandra mentioned. She didn’t expect them just to&nbsp;turn around and to&nbsp;leave the house in&nbsp;silence. A&nbsp;week later, she was informed that Matt didn’t have any property claims for their house, and he&nbsp;was ready to&nbsp;confirm it&nbsp;legally.</p><p>So, Sandra started a&nbsp;new life in&nbsp;her house and this was her small but a&nbsp;very significant victory over her cheating husband and his new wife.</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;totally love the way Sandra dealt with her husband’s infidelity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ee/e0e/249d8254aba5aa38e777fbf5a7.jpg><p>We&nbsp;think that Sandra rocked in&nbsp;her decision not to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;scandal after she found out about this pity affair. As&nbsp;probably many women, she really felt hurt, but she didn’t let her emotions take control over her.</p><p>We&nbsp;think Sandra will find a&nbsp;decent man, as&nbsp;she’s still in&nbsp;the perfect age for love and adventures, and we&nbsp;sincerely wish her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy and to&nbsp;never face an&nbsp;adultery again.</p><p>And here’s yet another fascinating life story, with a&nbsp;truly detective twist.
