This recent investment uptick is likely due, in part, to a declining appetite for corporate advocacy.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Morning Consult’s latest report on <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>brand engagement</a> found that fewer consumers now want to hear from companies on political and social matters than in previous years.
