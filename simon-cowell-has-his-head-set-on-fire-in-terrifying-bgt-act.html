He asked the judge to sit on a chair and then placed a black bag over his head. Miki proceeded to pour lighter fluid on the outside of the bag and then put a box over Cowell’s head.</p><p>The audience gasped as Miki lit two matches and dropped them into the box. He opened a window on the box to show that Cowell’s head was completely surrounded by flames. All the while, Cowell sat completely still, as if nothing was wrong.</p><p>The judges looked on in shock as Miki put out the fire and removed the bag from Cowell’s head. The judge didn’t seem aware of what everyone else had just witnessed, asking, “What happened?” However, he admitted, “That didn’t feel good.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL IS OKAY AFTER REPORTEDLY GETTING SET ON FIRE ON ‘BGT’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-dangerous-act-terrified-the-judges>The Dangerous Act Terrified the Judges</h2><p>After Cowell returned to his seat at the judges’ table, fellow judge Amanda Holden informed him of what had just happened, saying, “He set your head on fire.” Cowell was shocked to learn this.</p><p>“It was scary, wasn’t it?” Holden said. “And as much I don’t really want you to have to go through that again, it was massively entertaining and horrific all at once. With the amount of product that’s in that hair, that was a risk.”</p><p>Bruno Tonioli said he was “really captivated by it,” adding that he’s “never seen anything like it.” However, both Cowell and Alesha Dixon have seen Miki Dark before, as he competed on Season 2 of AGT: The Champions with an act that involved throwing a knife at Heidi Klum.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_NickCannon_Rebecca-SappGetty-Images-for-The-Recording-Academy-220x147.jpeg alt="Nick Cannon Admits to Mixing Up Handwritten Mother’s Day Cards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKGZo2K1qr%2BMoZyanF2osrV5zqdkn6GimnqquoytnKuqmZvGqrrGZpmgrF2WsLV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
