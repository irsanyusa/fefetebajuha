"Next year, I'm bringing hot dogs."</p><p>The plastic-wrapped sandwiches are thought to have come from Los Angeles restaurant and food market, Joan's on Third, whose ham and cheese sandwiches are on the fancier side, consisting of apricot-glazed ham and brie in an artisan ciabatta roll, and <a href=# id=f4da9171-3339-3800-afd5-3425c98675ca>costing $12.95 each</a> .</p><p>McCarthy's fellow attendees certainly seemed to appreciate her foresight and generosity.</p><p>"How did she get them in here?" Jessica Chastain asked, "But it's a good idea because by the time you get into the ballroom dinner has already been served, and you're always so hungry."</p><p>"Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" star Rachel Brosnahan revealed to Variety that she usually brings sustenance to the event too, but forgot this year.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And Olivia Colman, who won a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy or musical film for "The Favourite," even mentioned McCarthy's snacks in her speech: "Thank you for the sandwiches, amazing," she said.</p><p><strong>Read more: <span id=f10a3da8-33f6-3fc3-a020-8959555d00ea>Golden Globe winner Sandra Oh thanked her parents in Korean and people are loving it</span></strong></p><p>The positive reaction to the sandwiches perhaps isn't too surprising given celebrities haven't been entirely wowed by the Golden Globes' catering in previous years.</p><p>In 2018, for example, Chrissy Teigen revealed in a (now deleted) tweet that the food consisted of "f---in finger sandwiches."</p><p>This year, stars enjoyed an appetizer of sweet potato vichyssoise with wild micro chives, golden leeks, organic red garnet yams, and roasted pepitas.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The entre was Chilean seabass served with forbidden black rice, white and green asparagus, globe carrots, crispy herb leaves, and sweet pepper concasse.</p><p>The vegetarian alternative was stuffed honeynut squash: local organic honeynut squash, with piquillo pepper hummus, braised rainbow chard, crispy chickpeas, quinoa, golden raisins, and sunflower sprouts.</p><p>And dessert was a pistachio cream cheese ivory, made from flourless chocolate, vanilla kirsch genoise, and Cream Cheese Charlotte Pistachio Center</p><p>The menu was created by the Beverly Hilton's Executive Chef Matthew Morgan and Executive Pastry Chef Thomas Henzi.</p><p>But as delicious as it sounds, the undeniably light meal was unlikely to sustain anyone through the long evening ahead, especially given drinks at the Golden Globes are notoriously free-flowing.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><a href=# id=69072bdb-30bd-3671-a146-9531e4ddf60a>This year's official cocktail</a> is called the Mot Belle, consisting of cachaca, mango juice, ginger syrup, lime juice, and Mot & Chandon Champagne.</p><p>Thank goodness for Melissa McCarthy and her sandwiches.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8yeo6Kro5Z6rq%2FCmqmtoKliwK7BxqCjnpxdaH1utMCmZKyZnpnEqq%2FHnqpmoZ6pvG7Ax55koKecmbKvecalppudo2LBsHnSraapZZGjxm6%2F05qprGdlasVzrtej</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
