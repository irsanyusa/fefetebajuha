But despite the countless hurdles he&nbsp;encountered, with the unwavering support of&nbsp;his family and his own indomitable spirit, he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;let his condition define him. His story can serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful reminder that with the love of&nbsp;our friends and family, we&nbsp;can overcome any challenge that life throws our way.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;painful discovery</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc5/c87/3a5c2852faabb8cf1b1d85dacf.jpg><p>For new parents, the birth of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;joyous occasion. Unfortunately for Magda and Russel Newman, the reality was far from that. Magda’s long and difficult labor ended in&nbsp;shock when, instead of&nbsp;being handed her newborn, she was met with horrified expressions from the medical team.</p><p>Magda Newman’s 17-hour labor ended in&nbsp;a&nbsp;traumatic experience when doctors failed to&nbsp;<a href=# title=communicate data-link=tag>communicate</a> her newborn’s <a href=#>condition</a>. The lack of&nbsp;information left her fearing the worst and even thinking that her baby might have passed away. This highlights the importance of&nbsp;clear communication and transparency between healthcare providers and patients, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;can ease anxiety and prevent trauma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e7/401/ea796f56e08245660fefc496ec.jpg><p>“What’s going&nbsp;on? I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;see the baby,” Magda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> the doctors one more time. However, they wouldn’t give her an&nbsp;answer as&nbsp;they kept examining their baby. “I&nbsp;think they were scared at&nbsp;first. Because he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;cheekbones and no&nbsp;upper or&nbsp;lower eyelids, just completely disfigured,” the dad <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Russell was taken aside and presented with a&nbsp;textbook that contained a&nbsp;page featuring <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Treacher Collins</i></a> syndrome. The page included a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager affected by&nbsp;that condition. “I&nbsp;remember thinking, <strong>‘That’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;my&nbsp;kid?’ It&nbsp;was surreal.</strong>”</p><p>It&nbsp;was not easy for either of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with the news, and when Magda finally saw her little boy, all she could <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remember</a> was, “Something was very wrong. Did I&nbsp;deliver an&nbsp;alien?”</p><p><h2>Initially, they struggled to&nbsp;accept it&nbsp;and endured a&nbsp;long battle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebd/175/aeba5f545d80c3d288aa7490be.jpg><p>The unexpected news came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;shock to&nbsp;Magda and Russel Newman, causing their newborn boy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for the first month of&nbsp;his life. The anxious parents had to&nbsp;wait for weeks before they could hold their baby, which was a&nbsp;difficult and emotional experience. Finally, one evening, they were able to&nbsp;hold their son and come to&nbsp;terms with his <a href=#>condition</a>.</p><p>“We&nbsp;decided he’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;beautiful not because of&nbsp;his appearance but because of&nbsp;his personality,” Magda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “He’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful person.” Following their epiphany, the couple hastily made their way to&nbsp;the hospital to&nbsp;visit their beloved son. “We&nbsp;held Nathaniel for the first time. It&nbsp;was awesome. And then the journey started.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a2/a08/0a068c5d9ba853d522823fd5b3.jpg><p>Adapting to&nbsp;life with a&nbsp;baby diagnosed with Treacher Collins can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;daunting task, as&nbsp;Magda and Russell Newman learned firsthand. Despite their determination and positive outlook, the heart-wrenching reality of&nbsp;their situation left Magda in&nbsp;tears, “<strong>I&nbsp;almost cried every day. Every </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>single</strong></a><strong> time&nbsp;I looked at&nbsp;him, I&nbsp;could not believe it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;child.</strong>”</p><p>Nathaniel required extensive adjustments to&nbsp;be&nbsp;made to&nbsp;accommodate his physical and medical needs, including breathing and eating difficulties. But besides these challenges, his cognitive function was unaffected, and he&nbsp;was as&nbsp;capable as&nbsp;any other child.</p><p>He&nbsp;underwent over 10&nbsp;<a href=# title=surgeries data-link=tag>surgeries</a> in&nbsp;his first year, transforming his life, but not without sacrifice. His parents prioritized improving his quality of&nbsp;life over cosmetic changes but faced insensitive remarks from those who didn’t understand the choices they had to&nbsp;make. Nathaniel never received the praise he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deserved</a> because “he&nbsp;did not <a href=#>look</a> like a&nbsp;person.”</p><p><h2>Growing&nbsp;up, the boy had to&nbsp;deal with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;judgment.<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/071/abf/bc597b54eeae4a45ffb56dfcde.jpg><p>Over the years, the couple expanded their family and after consulting with medical professionals, they welcomed a&nbsp;second son, Jacob. Nathaniel and Jacob became inseparable, but Nathaniel soon became aware of&nbsp;his differences. He&nbsp;couldn’t help but notice the stares and screams he&nbsp;received from people, which made him feel self-conscious.</p><p>Children were afraid of&nbsp;his appearance, and one cruel kid even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> him a&nbsp;“monster.” Nathaniel’s heart ached as&nbsp;he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;understand why he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;different and why it&nbsp;caused so&nbsp;much pain.<br>“I&nbsp;realized they don’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;anybody else, so&nbsp;<strong>I was different</strong>,” Nathaniel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “I&nbsp;was insulted and kids don’t really think about what they’re saying.”</p><p>Despite the hurtful words and stares, Nathaniel’s family always shielded him from the negativity. His younger brother, in&nbsp;particular, was fiercely protective of&nbsp;him. “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Growing</a> up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;brother with TCS forced me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mature. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;protect Nathaniel when we&nbsp;were younger. I&nbsp;was his bodyguard.”</p><p><h2>How one movie changed his whole perception</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/435/746/0ca29b560c97d16d8b8e6fc232.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2012, the book <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wonder</i></a> was published, a&nbsp;book that holds a&nbsp;special place in&nbsp;Nathaniel’s heart. It&nbsp;tells the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl with facial differences and the challenges she faces in&nbsp;a&nbsp;society that struggles with acceptance. The book’s impact inspired Nathaniel and Magda to&nbsp;create 2&nbsp;similar books in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Inspired by&nbsp;their challenging journey, Magda wrote <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Normal: A&nbsp;Mother and Her Beautiful Son</i></a>, where she narrates their story. Likewise, Nathaniel wrote his own book titled <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Normal: One Kid’s Extraordinary Journey</i></a>, which also narrates his story, but from his perspective.</p><p>“I&nbsp;write in&nbsp;my&nbsp;book that, ‘I’m not normal, and neither are you,’” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>. “And what&nbsp;I mean is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;we&nbsp;were all normal, we’d all have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the same.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89b/592/21ea2c5074848cbc09f7e081c6.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2017, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wonder</i></a> was adapted into a&nbsp;movie, and it&nbsp;marked a&nbsp;life-changing moment for Nathaniel. The film transformed people’s perception of&nbsp;him, making them more compassionate and accepting.</p><p>“I&nbsp;was 8&nbsp;when it&nbsp;came out, and it&nbsp;changed everything. It&nbsp;spread a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;light on&nbsp;facial differences. People became more understanding,” Nathaniel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claims</a>. “Now, in&nbsp;school, I’m treated like everyone else. People are really nice.”</p><p>Nathaniel Newman is&nbsp;now thriving thanks to&nbsp;numerous surgeries that have allowed him to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;activities that were once out of&nbsp;reach. His story is&nbsp;a&nbsp;true example of&nbsp;how the unwavering support of&nbsp;family can help overcome even the toughest of&nbsp;obstacles. As&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a> by&nbsp;Magda, “Don’t let your life circumstances or&nbsp;how others perceive you determine how you choose to&nbsp;live your life. ‘Normal’ is&nbsp;how you choose to&nbsp;define&nbsp;it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqmsdNmpZqsmJa7qrHLZquhnV2XvLp51qGmZp%2BimsRuwc9mmZ6hnpx6pK3LpZydZZFiurC60q2cq2WnnbxuwMeepWaalZiurrGMmqVmoZ6ovaq%2BwK2gqKZdm7yzecSvnKuxn6OyboSQa21sa18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
