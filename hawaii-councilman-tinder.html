But the innocent effort did little to help his campaign. “At first, I put both genders—male and female,” said Ilagan, who is running for state senate (and happens to be single). “But because it’s a dating site, there were actually a lot of guys that were hitting on me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was always having to direct people back to the main focus,” he added. “They asked me, ‘Oh, can I have a date?’ And I said, ‘Well, we can have a meeting and we can talk about government and maybe you can help out on the campaign.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ilagan, 29, said his agenda was laid out on his <a href=# rel=noopener>Tinder</a> profile page, where he wrote: “Hey you! Help me make a positive difference in our community. Swipe right and let’s talk,” according to the Civil Beat. “This year, I am running for State Senate. I bet we can find common ground on issues and make a positive impact around us. Swipe right and let’s get to know each other,” the message continued.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I thought the one-on-one interaction would be great, but it just leads to other things,” he said. “Now I know why people don’t campaign on it. Tinder just has a different environment and different expectation. I learned the hard way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtaWlngHiCjqGYsJmZnnqku9SnmqKknZa7bsDIp5ueql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
