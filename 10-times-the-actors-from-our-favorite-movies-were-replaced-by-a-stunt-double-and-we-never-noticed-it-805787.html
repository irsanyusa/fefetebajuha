For example, moviemakers may want to&nbsp;save some time and film a&nbsp;few scenes simultaneously or&nbsp;reduce expenses by&nbsp;using a&nbsp;double who’s paid much less. Sometimes stunt doubles are invited to&nbsp;perform difficult stunts. However, viewers often can’t tell when they’re looking at&nbsp;their favorite actor or&nbsp;their double.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;found out that many famous movies had such replacements. And sometimes, it’s enough to&nbsp;pause a&nbsp;movie to&nbsp;see them.</p><p><h2><i>Twilight</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d3/279/80b83e57d7affa9133b05842ec.jpg><p>Very few people noticed that when Edward and Bella were running through the woods, the actors were replaced by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>people</a> who didn’t look like them at&nbsp;all. Even sidewise it’s obvious that these are not <a href=# title="Robert Pattinson" data-link=tag>Robert Pattinson</a> and Kristen Stewart but their doubles.</p><p><h2><i>Titanic</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e5/474/65b38f58b59ce070d646343da6.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;<i><a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a></i> where Rose and Jack are running away from the oncoming water, trying to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;boy. Rose’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>face</a> looks very strange at&nbsp;this moment, almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;mask. And it&nbsp;really&nbsp;is! There’s only Kate’s face in&nbsp;this scene, which was applied to&nbsp;the double’s face with the help of&nbsp;computer graphics.</p><p><h2><i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c2/99a/a67b38546ba4fadd1ed7dc3ad1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the scene about a&nbsp;robbery (season&nbsp;9, episode 15), <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston" data-link=tag>Jennifer Aniston</a> was replaced with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>another</a> girl. For an&nbsp;unknown reason, they even wear different shirts and have different hair colors. But very few people have likely noticed this replacement.</p><p><h2><i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/952/6d2/b369435b7aae841a61c990fe5c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the <i><a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a></i> film series, they often used <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a>. And it&nbsp;was quite reasonable because the movies had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stunts, which would’ve made the production last much longer if&nbsp;they were performed by&nbsp;the actors.</p><p>For example, in&nbsp;the scene with the chess game, Ron suddenly becomes unrecognizable. Perhaps Rupert Grint was replaced with a&nbsp;stunt double before falling from the knight. Most likely it’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Anthony Knight</a> who would appear in&nbsp;all 6&nbsp;movies of&nbsp;the franchise from time to&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2><i>Moonraker</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03b/735/da504454918b45e8892a9e1ac1.jpg><p>The villain in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Moonraker</i>, the character has steel teeth before jumping from the helicopter. But during the jump, his teeth become white. Even his appearance changes. This can be&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the fact that the stunts were performed by&nbsp;stunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a> Paul Weston and Martin Grace.</p><p><h2><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of&nbsp;Azkaban</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/028/d5d/b5b48d5a99b634468129da5aa4.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;already mentioned above, many stunt doubles were present in&nbsp;the <i>Harry Potter</i> film series. One of&nbsp;the franchise’s attentive viewers accidentally noticed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replacement</a> of&nbsp;the actor who played Severus Snape. This man doesn’t look like Alan Rickman at&nbsp;all. You can really tell the difference by&nbsp;their nose, hair, and chin.</p><p><h2><i>The Avengers</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/975/c12/4b12975ba8afab7d991c6f1efa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the scene of&nbsp;questioning, the Black Widow performs incredible acrobatic tricks, and it’s not surprising that <a href=# title="Scarlett Johansson" data-link=tag>Scarlett Johansson</a> was replaced with a&nbsp;stunt double. During one of&nbsp;the tricks on&nbsp;the chair, you can see an&nbsp;unfamiliar face and muscular hands on&nbsp;the Black Widow, which immediately lets you <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>know</a> that this is&nbsp;not Johansson.</p><p><h2><i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24a/5df/7bd52b502a8d3124d757ab1a2d.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the combat scenes, you might see that the captain is&nbsp;not Jean-Luc Picard anymore but another person. His strange hair is&nbsp;especially noticeable. Many stunts for Patrick Stewart in&nbsp;this series were performed by&nbsp;stunt double <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tim Storms</a>.</p><p><h2><i>Terminator&nbsp;2: Judgement Day</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbf/3af/4d7b3d5549a12bef0e09edce2e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the famous scene where the Terminator and John Connor are running away from the police, you might see that it’s not <a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> riding the motorcycle. Actually, the actor had a&nbsp;few stunt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubles</a> in&nbsp;the movie, including Norman Howell, Peter Kent, and Billy D. Lucas.</p><p><h2><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bf1/9a0/1333f15fb7bdf84dd304a640ed.png><p>Cersei Lannister was punished for her immoral behavior in&nbsp;season 5. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;redeem herself, she had to&nbsp;cut her hair and make the “walk of&nbsp;shame.” After the filming was finished, it&nbsp;turned out that Lena Headey had a&nbsp;body <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>double</a> who was actually walking nude with Lena’s head “attached” to&nbsp;her body with the help of&nbsp;computer graphics.</p><p>Did you notice doubles in&nbsp;other movies or&nbsp;shows?
