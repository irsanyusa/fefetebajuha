New Deal voters formed one of the most lasting political coalitions in American history, transforming expectations of the role government could play in people’s lives. Consumers who had experienced destitution remained financially vigilant, saving and squirreling away goods, always aware that the good times might not last. These enduring impacts were pivotal in shaping a generation and the contours of the nation.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">It was with that in mind that Morning Consult launched this tracker in May of 2020 to better understand how the coronavirus outbreak, another potentially era-defining and generation-altering moment, would impact Gen Z’s worldview. Then, less than a month after launch, yet another seismic event occurred: the death of George Floyd while in police custody and the subsequent protest movement it inspired. In response, we broadened the scope of this tracker to look more generally at how the tumult of 2020 — a pandemic, recession, protests, the upcoming election and more — has shaped this young generation’s habits, values and outlook on the world.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">The research covers a range of topics, including politics, consumer habits, trust in institutions, career expectations and more. The results are based on a tracking survey of 1,000 Americans ages 13-23.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0">This tracker is no longer being updated.
