Despite the harsh reviews from critics, the audience score tells a different story, standing at a more favourable 71% based on over 250 ratings.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-04470da5-784e-4c1b-ac3d-89635a1553bf data-caption="Critics score Divorce In The Black 0%"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/nX1ktkqTURBXy85YWQ5NWNjODM1MDI2YTA0NTI4ZGQ3M2E3ZDhmZTQ1NS5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQEOwsM></span><p>Divorce in the Black stars <strong>Meagan Good, Cory Hardrict, Joseph Lee Anderson, Taylor Polidore, Shannon Wallace, Richard Lawson,</strong> and <strong>Debbi Morgan. </strong>The film tells the story of Ava, a young bank professional whose life is upended when her husband, Dallas, abandons their marriage. Determined to fight for her relationship, Ava soon uncovers dark secrets that have tainted their union and once jeopardised her chance at true love.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tyler Perry, who wrote, directed, and produced the film, has been actively promoting it through various media appearances, sharing insights into the film's intense storyline and relatable characters. However, the critical reception has been less than kind.</p><p>The 11 critics whose reviews have been aggregated on Rotten Tomatoes have not minced their words. <strong>Andrew Lawrence</strong> of The Guardian UK called it "easily his (Tyler Perry's) worst film to date."</p><p>This marks a significant low for Perry, who has had a varied career of hits and misses. Despite the critical panning, the film seems to resonate better with the general audience, as reflected in its audience score.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-1f8f4f08-59d2-49af-8b66-67732fe4630d data-caption="The cast of Tyler Perry's new film Divorce In The Black [Getty Images]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/u9AktkpTURBXy9hOGU1Yjk2MjlkMGEyNjhkYWRhYWUyM2FmZmIwZTMzYS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNBH3Cww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Fans of Tyler Perry and the cast may still find value in the film's exploration of themes like betrayal, resilience, and the complexities of love. The divergence between critics' and audience's opinions highlights the subjective nature of film appreciation.</p><p>As Divorce in the Black continues to stream on Prime Video, it remains to be seen whether it will gain a more positive reception over time. For now, it stands as a polarising entry in Perry's extensive filmography.</p><p><strong>This content was created with the help of an AI model and verified by the writer.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8tcXLnqlmqJWnv7q%2FjJ2gr6eimLJutc1mq6GdXZe5oq%2FKZp6erKNiv6K%2BxGZnZquTpL%2Bmec6nZKunpKmyr3nTqKSarJ%2BawHCDkaSZca9l</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
