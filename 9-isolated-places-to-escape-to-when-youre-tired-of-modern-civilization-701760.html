If&nbsp;you’re wishing for an&nbsp;experience away from 21st-century modernity and stress, then packing for some of&nbsp;the most remote places on&nbsp;Earth is&nbsp;your solution. Don’t expect to&nbsp;get there by&nbsp;plane: Prepare for days of&nbsp;sailing across oceans, hiking high mountains, or&nbsp;diving into deep canyons. And don’t expect to&nbsp;find any supermarkets, Wi-Fi, or&nbsp;even currency there.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> has listed some of&nbsp;the most isolated destinations so&nbsp;that you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;have your own personal adventure. And you won’t believe our bonus at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article!</p><p><h2>1. Palmerston Island: A&nbsp;family-owned island</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d61/80d/ce9aef52da98b8512a3d1bc6ea.jpg><p><a href=#>Palmerston</a> Island is&nbsp;a&nbsp;coral atoll amid the Cook Islands in&nbsp;the Pacific, discovered by&nbsp;Captain James Cook. He&nbsp;named it&nbsp;after Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston.</p><p>The <a href=#>first</a> inhabitants were William Marsters, originally from Gloucestershire, and his 3&nbsp;Polynesian wives, who arrived in&nbsp;1863. All 62&nbsp;inhabitants descend from them: It’s a&nbsp;family-owned island.</p><p>You can <a href=#>expect</a> some modern amenities like a&nbsp;telephone station, electricity (2&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day), and internet (2&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day). But no&nbsp;more: There’s no&nbsp;airport and cargo ships only visit once or&nbsp;twice a&nbsp;year.</p><p>There are no&nbsp;shops, but that’s fine: <a href=#>Money</a> is&nbsp;not used here either, except with the outer world. You’ll find just one street, one church, 2&nbsp;toilets, one policeman, and plenty of&nbsp;fish and coconuts.</p><p><h2>2. Saint Helena: Where Napoleon spent his last days</h2></p><p>This is&nbsp;where <a href=#>Napoleon</a> was imprisoned in&nbsp;exile by&nbsp;the British and died in&nbsp;1821. And it’s no&nbsp;wonder: This volcanic island is&nbsp;<a href=#>located</a> in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean, 2,500 miles from Brazil and 1,210 miles from Angola.</p><p>The island was <a href=#>discovered</a> in&nbsp;1502 by&nbsp;João da&nbsp;Nova, a&nbsp;Portuguese navigator who named the island after Helena of&nbsp;Constantinople. Since then, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;stop for ships sailing to&nbsp;Europe from Asia and South Africa.</p><p>It’s also said that pirate and naval officer Sir Francis <a href=#>Drake</a> passed through these waters on&nbsp;his voyage around the world.</p><p>Today&nbsp;<a href=#>4,088</a>&nbsp;settlers, soldiers, and slave descendants call this place home. And although the island is&nbsp;extremely remote, they <a href=#>enjoy</a> electricity, internet, a&nbsp;brand new airport, and a&nbsp;colorful heritage.</p><p><h2>3. Utqiaġvik, Alaska: A&nbsp;land of&nbsp;extremes</h2></p><p>Also known as&nbsp;Barrow, this town is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a href=#>northernmost</a> communities on&nbsp;Earth and holds around 4,335 proud northerners.</p><p><a href=#>Utqiaġvik</a> means “place for gathering wild roots” and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;land that has been home to&nbsp;the Iñupiat, a&nbsp;community originally from Alaska, for more than 15&nbsp;centuries.</p><p>You can get there by&nbsp;plane, but be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;pack lots of&nbsp;scarves, it’s always <a href=#>winter</a> here. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;warm day temperatures can reach 32°F and on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold day it&nbsp;can fall to −30°F (mostly in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;February).</p><p>If&nbsp;you come between November and January, don’t expect to&nbsp;see any daylight. Locals are used to&nbsp;this phenomenon called polar night. And don’t worry, you’ll love the Aurora Borealis.</p><p><h2>4. Supay Village, Arizona: An&nbsp;authentic hidden jewel</h2></p><p>Located in&nbsp;the depths of&nbsp;Havasu Canyon (near the Grand Canyon), Supay Village is&nbsp;the capital of&nbsp;the Havasupai Indian Reservation, <a href=#>population</a>: 208.</p><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;get there, prepare for a&nbsp;long trip. There are no&nbsp;roads that lead to&nbsp;Supay, only helicopters and an&nbsp;8-mile <a href=#>trail</a>, which you can do&nbsp;by&nbsp;foot or&nbsp;by&nbsp;mule.</p><p>It’s so&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;arrive at&nbsp;the village that the U.S. Department of&nbsp;Agriculture has labeled it&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most <a href=#>remote</a> communities. But it’s worth&nbsp;it, you’re reward will be&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the quietest place in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>The Havasupay people <a href=#>live</a> off of&nbsp;irrigation farming, hunting, and natural waterfalls that provide them with clean water. The village also has a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;staying connected to&nbsp;the outside world: It&nbsp;gets its mail by&nbsp;mule.</p><p><h2>5. Pitcairn Island: Descendants of&nbsp;pirates</h2></p><p>It’s <a href=#>located</a> between Peru and New Zealand and its closest neighbors are the Pascua Islands, 1,900&nbsp;km to&nbsp;the east, and Mangareva, a&nbsp;small French Polynesian island, 490&nbsp;km to&nbsp;the northwest.</p><p>It’s the least populated jurisdiction on&nbsp;earth. Only 50&nbsp;people call Pitcairn home and most of&nbsp;them <a href=#>descend</a> from a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;mutineers and their Tahitian wives, giving them a&nbsp;pirate-like past.</p><p>The population lives on&nbsp;tourism, agriculture, and a&nbsp;monopoly of&nbsp;honey which, rumor has&nbsp;it, is&nbsp;so&nbsp;good it’s <a href=# title="Queen Elizabeth" data-link=tag>Queen Elizabeth</a>’s <a href=#>favorite</a>.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;the threat of&nbsp;extinction, the government has made many attempts to&nbsp;<a href=#>attract</a> migrants, but their efforts have failed. So, If&nbsp;you’re looking for isolation, look no&nbsp;further, this is&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>6. Siwa Oasis: The most isolated oasis</h2></p><p>This hidden gem has been isolated for centuries in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;Egypt’s Western Desert. It’s <a href=#>located</a> below sea level, 50&nbsp;km from the Libyan border and about 560&nbsp;km from Cairo.</p><p>To&nbsp;<a href=#>get</a> there you’ll have to&nbsp;hop on&nbsp;an&nbsp;overnight bus or&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;car. Due to&nbsp;their remoteness, the natives have been able to&nbsp;preserve their <a href=#>Berber</a> culture and Siwan language, making it&nbsp;an&nbsp;almost untouched culture in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Sure, you won’t get a&nbsp;good phone signal here, but who needs it&nbsp;when you can <a href=#>spend</a> the day admiring the palm groves, submerging in&nbsp;Cleopatra’s Bath mineral spring, and visiting the Oracle of&nbsp;Ammon, all while eating locally grown dates and olives.</p><p><h2>7. Tristan Da&nbsp;Cunha: The most remote island on&nbsp;Earth</h2></p><p>Tristan Da&nbsp;Cunha is&nbsp;the main <a href=#>island</a> of&nbsp;the most remote inhabited archipelago on&nbsp;the planet. It’s located in&nbsp;the Atlantic and has a&nbsp;population of&nbsp;only 247&nbsp;people.</p><p>Isolation begins before <a href=#>getting</a> to&nbsp;Tristan: There’s no&nbsp;airport and the only way to&nbsp;get there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;6-day trip by&nbsp;boat departing from South Africa.</p><p>Portuguese explorer Tristão da&nbsp;Cunha <a href=#>first</a> recorded the island in&nbsp;1506 and named it&nbsp;after himself, but it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the 1860s that the United Kingdom annexed the islands as&nbsp;their territory.</p><p>The population has no&nbsp;electricity, but they enjoy a&nbsp;theater, a&nbsp;cafe, and a&nbsp;grocery store. And you have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;adventurer to&nbsp;come here. The town lies on&nbsp;the skirts of&nbsp;a&nbsp;volcano that last erupted in&nbsp;1961.</p><p><h2>8. Santa Cruz del Islote, Colombia: The most populated island</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77e/3e3/15374b5467971acfbeae8e3b1f.jpg><p>It’s an&nbsp;artificial island off the Colombian coast and the most <a href=#>densely</a> populated island in&nbsp;the world. There are between 900 and 1,200 people living on&nbsp;land that is&nbsp;only about 2&nbsp;times the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;soccer field.</p><p>You won’t feel lonely here but you’ll definitely be&nbsp;forced to&nbsp;spend some time away from modern comfort. There’s no&nbsp;drinking <a href=#>water</a> and no&nbsp;<a href=#>sewage</a> which results in&nbsp;dispersed rubbish and pollution.</p><p>However, inhabitants are aware of&nbsp;this and are <a href=#>working</a> on&nbsp;recycling and environmental care programs. They already use solar panels to&nbsp;have access to&nbsp;electricity, so&nbsp;they’re on&nbsp;their way.</p><p>You’ll enjoy this crime-free island. There are no&nbsp;<a href=#>policemen</a> because people trust each other to&nbsp;the fullest. Their sense of&nbsp;community is&nbsp;as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;it&nbsp;can get.</p><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;come here you must hurry&nbsp;up. Santa Cruz del Islote is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;sink eventually due to&nbsp;rising sea levels, so&nbsp;let this be&nbsp;your next destination.</p><p><h2>9. Changtang, Tibet: The Roof of&nbsp;the World</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;can get very quiet <a href=#>up</a>&nbsp;here on&nbsp;the “Roof of&nbsp;the World,” even more in&nbsp;Changtang, which is&nbsp;located at&nbsp;more than 15,000&nbsp;ft above sea level, making it&nbsp;the highest place on&nbsp;the Tibetan Plateau.</p><p>Changtang is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;the <a href=#>Changpa</a>, a&nbsp;nomadic tribe that lives off of&nbsp;their livestock. The environment is&nbsp;too rough to&nbsp;practice agriculture, but they get what they need through small trade.</p><p>They exchange animal goods like cheese, milk, and unprocessed cashmere for grains, pots, knives, and other modern and useful products.</p><p>The <a href=#>wildlife</a> here is&nbsp;exceptional. It&nbsp;includes brown bears, snow leopards, kiangs (wild donkeys), and wild yaks, a&nbsp;Tibetan symbol. This is&nbsp;why it’s protected within the Changtang Nature Reserve.</p><p><h2>BONUS</h2></p><p><h2>Iquitos, Peru: The largest city in&nbsp;the world where you can’t arrive by&nbsp;car</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc4/f4a/2d0d0a5b64843e49407b9c7c5f.jpg><p>Encapsulated in&nbsp;the never-ending Amazonian rainforest, this city, with a&nbsp;population of&nbsp;half a&nbsp;million, is&nbsp;your go-to destination if&nbsp;you’re seeking adventure without sacrificing modern comfort. Just bear in&nbsp;mind that you can only <a href=#>get</a> there by&nbsp;plane or&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;4-day boat trip.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 17th century, <a href=#>Spaniards</a> made contact with the natives and since then the population has been in&nbsp;contact with many other cities.</p><p>You can enjoy long excursions inside the jungle, navigate through the Amazon River, and marvel watching and feeding animals you don’t see every day like manatees, pink dolphins, sloths, and tarantulas.</p><p>So&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us Bright Siders, which of&nbsp;these destinations caught your eye?
