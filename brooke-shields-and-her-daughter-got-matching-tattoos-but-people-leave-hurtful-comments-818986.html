Tattoo artist Scott Campbell <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> photos of the stylish pair proudly showing off their new ink on <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>, including a close-up of their matching tattoos.</p><p>The tattoos symbolize Grier taking a step into her mother's shoes, with Shields by her side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51b/8ac/3fd0c459278bc16147107e1401.jpg><p>The tattoo design, depicted in&nbsp;black-and-white, portrays a&nbsp;child wearing oversized heels while standing face-to-face with her mother, who is&nbsp;also donning similar footwear.</p><p>Campbell, known for his <i>“Stupid Things for Love”</i> <a href=# title=podcast data-link=tag>podcast</a>, conducted an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with Shields and Henchy for a&nbsp;special Mother’s Day episode. During the discussion, the famous <a href=# title=actress data-link=tag>actress</a> explained the meaning behind their shoe-themed tattoos. Shields recounted how her daughter, from a&nbsp;young age, loved wearing her shoes, regardless of&nbsp;how big they were. She noted that Grier’s entire foot could fit inside the shoe’s toe box.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/11e/9db/7314765335b04dd29ea9345400.jpg><p>Shields <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a> a heartwarming series of images on Instagram revealing her new tattoo, accompanied by the caption "Matching tattoos with both of my girls. There’s nothing like being a mama." For the tattoo session, the duo chose comfortable attire. Shields wore high-waisted jeans and a graphic T-shirt, while Grier sported a pastel pink cardigan over a tank top paired with jeans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/894/3ca/f32596554aa4c7d68d52c1ae53.jpg><p>Some people didn't appreciate the tattoo and thought it was a way to promote Shields' new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie</a>, <i>"Mother of the Bride"</i>. "For a movie? Kinda cringe," one user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>. "Not a fan of tattoos in any way," another follower added.</p><p>However, many people found the matching tattoos adorable. "Matching tattoos are always really thoughtful and cool," one user wrote. "Love it! My daughter and I have the same small heart," another follower shared.</p><p>Whether it's a new tattoo or a photo of a growing baby bump, people always find peculiar details in photos celebrities share online. When Hailey Bieber recently posted a picture of her expanding belly, many people <a href=#>noticed</a> the same thing. And it's definitely not something you'd expect to see in pregnancy shots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2Bzu86knGarmJ6yrbDSZpinnF2dsrN5w5qsoKCkmr9us86tZKaZpJi1qrrGZquarKSkvLR5wa6rZqiVpL2tsYylnJqulWK1tr7Tn6ylZZOkuq6xza2qZnBhbYZ5go4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
