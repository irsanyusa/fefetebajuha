She has watched from the sidelines, helpless but hopeful, as the very foundations of her marital home were ripped off from beneath her feet and laid waste by greed and the lust for strange flesh.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nuella is just an opportunist. She's typical of a Nigerian hustler, pitching her tent where the grass is green. She perceived the weakness in Tchidi, whose pants are always spotting an aching bulge, and with that she came in. She not only found a way into his bed, but also was directly involved in the dissolution of his previous one, and setting up a new one. She's in her heaven. Rolling in newfound marital bliss.</p><p>But who's to blame for the entirety of this problems. Who is responsible for ruining the lives of Sophia, and her 3 children?</p><p>Many will stretch their fingers the way of Nuella, and for the most part they can be forgiven. Nuella has a home she stole from Sophia and her kids. She put her nose and her body where it didn't belong, and began a series of events which has led to her marriage. She didn't cover herself in glory, but she's the wrong person to point fingers at.</p><p>Sophia is blameless. There's only as much as a discarded woman can do to regain favour. Once love leaves your path, it seldom finds its way back.</p><p>Tchidi Chikere should take the fall for this. He is responsible for this situation. When a man's sexual appetite leaves the warmth of his wife and sails to strange pleasures, then trouble will always brew. Chikere has a cchronic playboy reputation. Before Nuella, there were others, and after Nuella, there will be many others. He found Nuella, brought her into his bed, and gave her a ring. He is the villain.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nuella and Tchidi's marriage is sweet...for now. But the very things that brought them together will always be a cloud hanging over their heads. As my people say, “Cane wey them take flog first wife, the thing still dey hang for the next wife.”.</p><p>Nuella and Tchidi are not an item. Their marriage, forged out of tears and intrigue, will still bite the dust. Heaven help them.</p><p><strong>Farewell To Zara</strong></p><p>Humans will always be hypocrites. <a href=# id=7fb11d2a-cdeb-516e-9f65-9889bb7f4a91>Zara Gretti's</a> is a sad lesson which reveals the true nature of people. Young and bright, Zara had a condition that was incurable but could be managed. That drained all the money she had, put a strain on her friends and family, and needed assistance.</p><p>She bit the humble pie, and released a video soliciting for funds from all of her friends, and insider reports reveal that she got a paltry sum, not even fit for a shot of her drugs. She got nothing from anyone.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Then she died, and the world knows her.</p><p>A<a href=# id=774c23c8-0add-5fa5-9f96-b59ef578cf55>ll over the industry, everyone has become a friend suddenly.</a> Sudden friendship. 'Rest In peace' Zara, they all screamed, writing odes,and sad one-liners that only reveal how fickle they are in friendship. Zara's death even became fashionable. Many female celebrities found an excuse to whip out a black getup and look pretty and sultry.</p><p>In death, Zara was a celebrity, but while she lived, she lacked true friends. The reality of that is damning, and makes one question the hearts of men. Do nobility and sincerity still exist?</p><p>They do. But in Nigeria, you'll be hard pressed to find it.</p><p>See you next week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02ihqJ2pqHquu82dmLJlnarAqrrGrGStm5iesap5wqGgpJ2imnqprdJmpJqqop6ypXnHnqOlZ6OchXXEkbM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
