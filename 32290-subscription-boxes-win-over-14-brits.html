A third (33%) say they want to treat themselves, while about three in ten (31%) do it to try new products. And one in seven people (14%) simply sign up to avoid going to the shops. The data is from the last twelve months, meaning it's recorded before and during the pandemic.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Untitled-2-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Despite growing popularity, subscription boxes have not yet caught on with most Brits (84%). Many say it’s because they prefer choosing their own products (40%). A similar number are put off by the cost (38%), while a third (33%) actually enjoy going to the shops. A fifth (21%) also say the types of boxes currently on offer don’t interest them.</p><p><strong>Younger people are more susceptible to subscribing to a box</strong></p><p>Subscription box fans tend to be male (59% vs 49% of all Brits) and are often younger. About half are millennials (53%), and they are more likely than the wider population to not yet have had children (39% vs 27%), have a young family (13% vs 5%) or an adult family (25% vs 16%). The wider population is, on the other hand, more likely than box customers to have adult children who’ve moved out.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Untitled-1-01-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Social grade also plays some role. About three in five subscription box users (59%) are ABC1s, meaning they’re more likely to work in professional jobs. This compares to 54% of all Brits.</p><p>Their advertisement habits also differ from the rest of the population. About one in seven (15%) like adverts on influencer blogs or vlogs, while only 4% of the public agree. Promotions on podcasts (11% vs 4%) and online advertising in general (28% vs 20%) also perform better with this segment.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Find out more about YouGov Profiles</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2d%2FenyMrKybq5OntrHAyKilZpqfrbK0edaipWanppq%2Fbn2TZpmroaSo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
