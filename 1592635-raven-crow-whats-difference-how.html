They are heavier, longer, and have wider wings. Their feathers look ragged when fluffing up their chest, but crows tend to fluff them into a mane. Compared to crows, they have more curved beaks.</p><p class=align-left>The throat feathers also provide a physical difference between the two.

According to the National Audubon Society, crows flap their wings in flight, whereas ravens fly more like raptors by using thermal air currents to soar. Ravens make a swishing sound while the crows beat their wings silently.</p><p class=align-left>Because crows' tail feathers are generally uniform in length, they have a fan-shaped appearance in flight. On the other hand, Ravens' tail feathers vary in length, giving them a wedgeâ€”or diamond-shaped tail in flight.</p><h3 id=1592635-crow-vs-raven-movement-and-sound class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Crow vs raven movement and sound</h3><p class=align-left>Both species have close-knit family units and are friendly and <a href=#>beautiful birds</a>. However, ravens typically travel in pairs, while crows are prone to travel in larger groups. Crows like being in human-populated areas and are, therefore, likely to be seen in urban landscapes, while ravens prefer livestock and sheep and are mainly found in wilder areas.</p><p class=align-left>Hearing their calls, you can tell the difference between a crow and a raven. Ravens call with a deeper, throatier croaking sound, while crows make an even caw, caw sound.

Crows, the size of a pigeon, are four times bigger than the blackbird.</p><p class=align-left>Blackbirds belong to a different family, Turdidae. In flight, they have a long tail that ends in a point. The male blackbird has a yellowish-orange beak, whereas the females are primarily brown in appearance. Out of the three, blackbirds are the least social.
