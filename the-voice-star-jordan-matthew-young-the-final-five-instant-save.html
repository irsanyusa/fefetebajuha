According to his <a href=#>The Voice bio</a>, he played in one of the state’s best marching bands in high school, before moving to live with his father. He then worked on rebuilding the band program at his new school, and ended up running it once he graduated, before leaving to pursue his music career.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘THE VOICE’ COACHES TAUNT NICK JONAS FOR UPCOMING BILLBOARD HOSTING GIG</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jordan-fixes-up-guitars>Jordan Fixes Up Guitars</h3><p>Jordan frequently posts on Instagram about his work fixing up guitars. Last year, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the singer’s ability to perform music, so he moved from Texas back to his hometown in Utah and took up guitar work. He’s described it on Instagram as his <a href=# class=broken_link>“side hustle.”</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CIBW8UXBvbh/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-worked-for-his-family-s-construction-company>He’s Worked for His Family’s Construction Company</h3><p>After moving back home during the pandemic, Jordan also took up work <a href=# class=broken_link>building houses</a> with his family’s construction business. His trip to California to appear on The Voice was a welcome relief after living in a crowded house for months.</p><p>“I was swinging a hammer, busting ass all day,” Jordan told the <a href=#>Austin Chronicle</a>. “I was staying at my dad’s house with my step-mother, two half sisters, a cousin, and her boyfriend – like seven of us. Staying in the hotel room alone was kind of incredible. It was just total silence, my own bed, my own bathroom.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>KELLY CLARKSON AND JAKE HOOT MESMERIZE VIEWERS WITH DUET ON ‘THE VOICE’</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jordan-plays-in-a-band>Jordan Plays in a Band</h3><p>Jordan has a band which was formerly called Candy’s River House, but is now simply Jordan Matthew Young. According to <a href=#>his website</a>, they’ve shared the stage with ZZ Top and won at the Best of Utah Music Awards. Jordan plays guitar and sings lead vocals, with<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Joey Davis on the drums and Nathan Simpson on the bass.</p><p>The band released an EP called <a href=#>Stolen in the Middle of the Night</a> in 2014, and the album <a href=#>Another Night</a> in 2015 under the name Jordan Matthew Young.

So I just go about my job, playing music every day, and hopefully what I did on TV turns out good. I showed up, sang as best I could, and tried not to look like an idiot.”</p><p>Jordan will perform in the Season 20 Finals next Monday at 8 p.m. ET. We’ll find out if America voted for him when the finale airs on Tuesday night on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Simon-Cowell-WhatsApp-Group.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell is Apparently NOT in the ‘BGT’ Judges Whatsapp Group" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedKtmKtlmqS%2Fpa3NZqSarKSdsrh52Kisp59dqbWmecWipZqkXZu2t7GMoqWsrJGjwW6%2FwK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
