The actress has been fully open about the challenges she’s had to&nbsp;face in&nbsp;the industry and how her height significantly impacted which roles she could take. And today, Christie is&nbsp;feeling more comfortable than ever in&nbsp;her own skin and is&nbsp;sharing her unique journey in&nbsp;all honesty.</p><p><h2>She’s always been typecast in&nbsp;certain roles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/044/337/9d0f7b5380853bb90cd3b56d14.jpg><p>We’ve grown accustomed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seeing</a> Christie in&nbsp;popular movies or&nbsp;hit&nbsp;TV shows, such as&nbsp;<i>Star Wars, The Hunger Games</i>,<i> </i>and<i> Game of&nbsp;Thrones.</i> And speaking of&nbsp;her role as&nbsp;Brienne of&nbsp;Tarth in&nbsp;the latter, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that the character was ’’bold and assured and proud," however, she also acknowledges that playing Brienne was a&nbsp;big challenge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03e/f99/82cd525439b03e6816e2d21cba.jpg><p>The 44-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that her character ’’was often looked down upon because of&nbsp;the way she looked and her aim to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman and a&nbsp;knight.’’ She also noted, ’’That character was having to&nbsp;overcome a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;shame regarding the way society treated the character.’’</p><p>And to&nbsp;get into the skin of&nbsp;her character, Christie had to&nbsp;transform herself and adopt Brianne’s ultra-masculine look. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, ’’I had to&nbsp;take my&nbsp;hair away. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;acknowledge my&nbsp;height, my&nbsp;strength, my&nbsp;size, my&nbsp;androgyny, and also my&nbsp;vulnerability. But I&nbsp;also had to&nbsp;really go&nbsp;down to&nbsp;the gym!’’</p><p><h2>She finally found the role that made her feel beautiful.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/770/c47/af3fb15e278cbf0de2995c20fa.jpg><p>Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>However, Christie’s more recent role as&nbsp;Larissa Weems in&nbsp;the hit series, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wednesday</i></a>, was very different from her older parts. She even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, ’’It is&nbsp;the first time I’ve ever felt beautiful on-screen.’’</p><p>And the actress gives major credit to&nbsp;the show’s costume designer, Colleen Atwood, for making her feel right in&nbsp;her element.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/374/cb8/031e315b2f89d8046d09287a43.jpg><p>Christie explained that she and Atwood sat down and discussed the visual aesthetic of&nbsp;Larissa and had ’’these wonderful fittings.’’</p><p>The star praised the designer, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, ’’She always made me&nbsp;feel celebrated. She made me&nbsp;feel that my&nbsp;body was beautiful&nbsp;— that&nbsp;<i>I</i> was beautiful, that&nbsp;I wear clothes well, and that my&nbsp;ideas were welcome and relevant.’’</p><p><h2>Fashion has always been there for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4c/5da/a1bd0554b0b0edc093de3093c2.jpg><p>Despite having a&nbsp;more challenging path as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, Christie admitted that she always felt that the <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> industry welcomed her with open arms. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, "It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;long time for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel embraced by&nbsp;the acting industry, but the fashion industry did embrace me.’’ She also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that as&nbsp;she was growing&nbsp;up, fashion was her ’’most immediate way of&nbsp;transforming.’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d9/122/91000c505da9ff16d451b4e938.jpg><p>But as&nbsp;she grew older, her opinion of&nbsp;her body changed. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, ’’You either exist in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state of&nbsp;shame about not fitting into society or&nbsp;you embrace what you have.’’</p><p>And luckily, Christie ended up&nbsp;accepting and loving her unique height and frame.
