There’s something about this kind of bedding that invites you to wrap yourself in it with a warm cup of tea and a good book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Quilts are also often cherished heirlooms that are handed down over the years. If you’re lucky, you will have a quilter in your life. I own quilts handed down from aunts and grandmothers, and I bet some of you readers do as well. My husband’s extremely talented cousin quilts gorgeous, colorful creations for her loved ones, and her high-quality quilts are beautiful (and useful) works of art.&nbsp;</p><p>If quilts don't play a role in your family tree, it’s okay—most don’t. Finding the right quilt will really depend on your style, your budget, or your family. I’ve rounded up some shopping suggestions to help you find the perfect one for yourself or others. Note: These make fantastic gifts!</p><h2 id=what-to-consider>What to consider</h2><h3>Is it a quilt or a coverlet?&nbsp;</h3><p>Quilts have been around for a very long time and they’ve evolved over the centuries. This type of bedding is traditionally made from two layers of fabric with insulation in between and tends to be thinner than comforters. So if you’re looking for warmth, you might want a colorful comforter instead. (You can find suggestions for some of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best comforters</a> here.)</p><p>Don’t confuse quilts with a coverlet, which is similar to a quilt but only has one layer. These are similar to a blanket for decorative bedding or simply an extra layer.&nbsp;</p><h3>Do you prefer decorative or plain?&nbsp;</h3><p>Quilts are known for their decorative patterns, but you can also buy simple or plain quilts in one color or with discreet stitching. You can find traditional patterns in quilts, such as timeless quilting stitching patterns like the “Lover’s Knot” and “Sunburst,” along with more modern takes. Consider your personal style and whether you prefer a decorative pattern, or something simpler.&nbsp;</p><h3>How much do you want to spend?</h3><p>The good news is you can find quilts at practically every price point and if you don’t mind buying a second-hand one, scouring garage and yard sales is a good place to save. Otherwise, you can find beautiful items on eBay or Etsy and a few options from major retailers, but take note that some cheaper quilts may not be as durable over time as high-quality ones. The <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy bedding</a> will often sell quilts too, along with blankets.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-quilts>Our picks for the best quilts</h2><h3>Best budget quilt: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wayfair Basics® Microfiber Reversible Diamond Quilt Set</a></h3><p>This affordable plain quilt comes in six neutral colors and will likely appeal to shoppers with a minimalistic style.

This quilt won our “best kids’ quilt category for its whimsical yet not-too-childish aquatic design, made from 100% cotton. It’s also reversible with a navy blue backing if you want to switch up the bedding. It would be perfect in a nautical-style bedroom or for an ocean-loving child. If your child gets cold, easily pair this with a <a rel=alternate href=#>down comforter</a>.&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: 100% cotton, 100% polyester batting</li><li>Sizes: Twin, Full/Queen</li><li>Color variations: One design</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price on publish: $239 Full/Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Beautiful rendition of sea life&nbsp;</li><li>Machine washable</li><li>Mid-weight cotton</li><li>Quilt and sham set available</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>If your child loves the ocean and all the sea life teeming within it, this is the quilt for them.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best kid’s quilt</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Pottery Barn Kids Save Our Seas Quilt</h3></p><h3>Best sustainable quilt: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Garnet Hill Siesta Upcycled Organic Cotton Quilt</a></h3><p>This upcycled organic-cotton quilt is a wonderful jumble of block patterns from solids to stripes. Made from remnants of organic cotton percale bedding, this repurposed cozy quilt has hand-quilting along the seams. Traditional handmade quilts typically use upcycled materials, and Siesta has done a great job of creating a similar type of seemingly “homespun” quilt on a broader scale. But rest easy because you can still throw this hand-crafted quilt in the wash.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: 100% organic cotton fabric and batting</li><li>Sizes: Twin, Double/Queen, King/California King</li><li>Color variations: One design but may vary slightly&nbsp;</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price on publish: $299 Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Machine washable</li><li>Made from remnants and repurposed percale cotton</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Its slightly old-fashioned appearance in muted colors and patterns, which I love, may not be for everyone.&nbsp;</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>Durable organic cotton, recycled remnants, and a pretty block pattern come together to create what may become a family heirloom over time.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best sustainable quilt</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Garnet Hill Siesta Upcycled Organic Cotton Quilt</h3></p><h3>Best quilt for hot sleepers: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brooklinen Reversible Linen Quilt</a></h3><p>Brooklinen bedding never disappoints (they made our list for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best luxury sheets</a>, among other bedding products), and this reversible linen quilt is a great addition to your bed or guest room. It is great for easily overheated sleepers because linen is a lightweight fabric. The quilt is pre-washed (super soft), reversible (so it’s like getting two quilts for the price of one), and made from European flax with long-staple fibers. Pair this with some breathable percale <a rel=alternate href=#>bed sheets</a> for a cool yet cozy night’s sleep.&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: 100% European flax linen</li><li>Sizes: Full/Queen, King/California King</li><li>Color variations: Two (Indigo Blue Stripe and Pebble Grey Stripe)</li><li>Care: Machine washable in cold water</li><li>Price on publish: $144.07- $288.15 Full/Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Machine washable</li><li>A modern twist on a classic quilt</li><li>Comfortable year-round if you get easily hot at night</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>Brooklinen’s linen quilt is a good alternative to cotton and comes in modern colors and designs.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best quilt for hot sleepers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Brooklinen Reversible Linen Quilt size King/Cali King in Indigo Mixed Stripe</h3></p><h3>Best lightweight quilt: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Company Store Voile Quilt&nbsp;</a></h3><p>If you’re looking for a lightweight, no-fuss all-cotton quilt, this makes a great choice for the warmer months (or layered during the cooler ones) with all-cotton fill.

Made from 100% viscose from organic bamboo, it’s a nice alternative to a polyester tufted material.

Bean Flying Geese Quilt Collection</a></h3><p>This quilt reminds me of homes in New England, which isn’t a surprise because this cotton quilt comes from Maine-based L.L. Bean. This no-nonsense quilt is made from cotton fabric and batting and is designed in a traditional flying geese pattern. It is warm, comfortable, and an instant classic. LL Bean sells all kinds of quality bedding and this paired with a neutral <a rel=alternate href=#>duvet cover</a> will look good in any bedroom.&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: 100% cotton fabric and batting</li><li>Sizes: Twin, Full/Queen, King</li><li>Color variations: One (flying geese pattern in muted colors)</li><li>Care: Machine washable in cold water</li><li>Price on publish: $279 Full/Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Mid-weight material</li><li>Heirloom-quality</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only one color choice within the design</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>LL Bean makes a no-fuss, pretty, all-cotton quilt that is mid-weight and cozy.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best traditional-style quilt</span></p><p><h3 class=title>L.L. Bean Flying Geese Quilt Collection</h3></p><h3>Best rivulets quilt: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Anthropologie Rivulets Quilt</a></h3><p>Rivulet quilts are textured bedding made from a stream of tucked and tufted ruffles and textured embellishments. Anthropologie made this quilt out of extremely soft cotton jersey material. While a textured quilt may not be for everyone, if you are searching for a rivulet quilt, this is an affordable and well-made choice. This beautiful drapey bedding will add a little romantic style to your boudoir. You will need to dry clean it, so consider carefully how much ruffles mean to you.&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: Cotton jersey with polyester fill</li><li>Sizes: Twin, Full, Queen, King</li><li>Color variations: Five colors, including a gorgeous teal and a sunny ochre</li><li>Care: Dry clean only</li><li>Price on publish: $328 Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Extremely pretty</li><li>Very soft (jersey cotton)</li><li>Well-made&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Dry clean</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>If you love textured bedding with a dramatic flair (and don’t mind paying for dry cleaning) this Rivulet Quilt is all that but also extremely soft thanks to its jersey fabric.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best rivulets quilt</span></p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.urbndata.com/is/image/Anthropologie/45405812AA_012_a11?$a15-pdp-detail-shot$&amp;amp;fit=constrain&amp;amp;fmt=webp&amp;amp;qlt=80&amp;amp;wid=1080" alt="Anthropologie Rivulets Quilt" title="Anthropologie Rivulets Quilt" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Anthropologie Rivulets Quilt</h3></p><h3>Best decorative quilt: <a rel=nofollow href=#>NNDØ HÜNI (Etsy) Made-To-Order Otomi Hand Embroidered Quilt In Amber Ocher Gold</a></h3><p>If you want to buy a quilt that is decorative and functional, Etsy is a great one-stop shop to find both unusual and classic patterns and a wide range of quilt designs. I’ve chosen this custom-made, hand-embroidered quilt of animals because of its beautiful fabric, design, and ochre gold color. But a search in Etsy's quilt and bedding section can help you find the best quilt for your style and budget. And because there are so many artisans in one online location, you may be able to find a champion quilter who will create a custom one just for you.&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: 100% cotton</li><li>Sizes: Baby, Crib, Throw, Twin, Full, Queen, King, California King</li><li>Color variations: One (Amber Ocher Gold)</li><li>Care: N/A</li><li>Price on publish: $1,070 Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Made by Otomi artisans in Mexico</li><li>Etsy Star Seller</li><li>It’s a piece of art and a functional quilt</li><li>Lightweight</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive for some budgets</li><li>Takes 12 weeks before it ships</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>If you are looking for a decorative quilt, this one is made by Otomi artisans in Mexico who create works of art you can sleep on.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best decorative quilt</span></p><p><h3 class=title>NNDØ HÜNI (Etsy) Made-To-Order Otomi Hand Embroidered Quilt In Amber Ocher Gold</h3></p><h3>Best quilt on Amazon: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bedsure Lightweight Quilt Set</a></h3><p>If you need a lightweight (and extremely affordable) quilt set and want to choose from 39 colors, this is a great option and an “Amazon’s Choice” winner. These quilts are machine washable and affordable, so they’re ideal if you want a durable, modern quilt with shams. The twin bedding would be a good choice to brighten up a teen or college student’s dorm room, while providing an extra layer of warmth. It may be too lightweight to keep you warm during cold seasons, but it would be preferred as a stand-alone blanket in warm months. Because it is available in so many colors, it is an easy addition to bedding you already own.&nbsp;</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Material: 100% polyester</li><li>Sizes: Twin/Twin XL, Full/Queen, King, California King</li><li>Color variations: 39 choices</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price on publish: $27.44 - $39.99 Full/Queen</li></ul><h4>What we like:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Inexpensive</li><li>Dense stitching makes it durable</li><li>Comes with two shams</li><li>OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 certified</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some people don’t like sleeping on polyester bedding, even if it is OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 certified.</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:&nbsp;</h4><p>Simple, affordable, and OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 certified, this simple, modern quilt comes in a wide range of colors.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best quilt on Amazon</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bedsure Queen Quilt Bedding Set - Lightweight Summer Quilt Full/Queen - Grey Bedspreads Queen Size - Bedding Coverlets for All Seasons (includes 1 Quilt, 2 Pillow Shams)</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-quilts>How we selected the best quilts</h2><p>As someone who was lucky to grow up with several quilters in the family, it was important that the options that made this list were high-quality. While it’s impossible for a mass-produced quilt to compare to a hand-made one, the upside is that mass-produced quilts are a bit more accessible and easier to care for. To find the quilts that gave the decorative appeal but also could withstand daily use, I looked at a few factors to guide my recommendations: The overall stitching (especially if it contributed to the pattern/design), the material (cotton gave more of a classic quilt feel, though I also considered poly/synthetics as they were extremely durable), and the overall style (as some products labeled quilts look more like duvets or comforters). In addition, I wrapped myself up in a few, asked colleagues and friends to weigh in on what they like, researched what makes a high-quality quilt, plus took a deep dive into customer reviews. I compared price points and manufacturing processes for the most durable and decorative quilts.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=best-place-to-buy-quilts>Best place to buy quilts</h2><p>Estate sales, yard and garage sales are the best places to buy authentic vintage quilts. (In addition, specialty artisan fairs, Etsy, and eBay are also great options.) However, if you’re looking for a good quilt from a major retailer, L.L. Bean, Quince, and Anthropologie were my favorite choices for their overall style, stitching, and quality.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=how-to-store-quilts>How to store quilts</h2><p>Wrap quilts, especially fragile heirlooms, away from damp or humid areas in the home, like attics, basements, or garages. It is recommended that you wrap your quilts in clean cotton sheets or pillowcases. Some people, myself included, also keep quilts in a cedar chest, which are water, fire, and decay resistant, and repel insects. Fold the quilt carefully so that you don’t disturb the folds or pleats, if, say, it is made from blocks. Always store with the backside facing out if your quilt only has a decorative front.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How can you tell a good quality quilt?</h3><p>Most high-quality quilts have a few things in common: durability, the quality of the fabric, and how it is pieced together—by hand or machine. Most quilting experts like traditional cotton best, and if you're looking for an heirloom or antique quilt, this is likely the fabric you will find. Quilts need to be stitched evenly, and the quilting itself should be evenly distributed, with precise sewing and pressing of the materials.&nbsp;</p><h3>How much should you pay for a quilt?</h3><p>It depends on the quilt and your budget. You may be able to find a bargain for under $50, but likely you will pay upwards of $100 or more. Decorative quilts (art versus bedding) could run thousands and thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are the three main types of quilts?</h3><p>Although there are other kinds of quilts, especially in the current mass-market, there are three traditional types of quilts: Patchwork (made from different blocks of fabric), applique quilts, and embroidered quilts.&nbsp;</p><h3>How long should a quilt last?</h3><p>A quality quilt could last for years, decades, or even generations, depending on how well you care for it.&nbsp;</p><h3>What type of quilt is best for year-round use?</h3><p>I own two beautiful quilts and I swap them every two seasons. There is a sunny yellow and white one for warmer months and a deep red and blue one for the colder ones. However, if you want to purchase just one, you should look for a lighter weight cotton quilt. You can use it on its own (in spring and summer) and with a comforter or other blankets (in fall and winter).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loaq2rcDSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
