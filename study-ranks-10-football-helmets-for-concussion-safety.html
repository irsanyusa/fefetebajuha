From these statistics, scientists were able to specify the speeds and tackling angles that would most likely to lead to concussions.</p><p>(<strong>More on TIME.com:</strong> <a href=#>Fan Rage: How Home Team Losses Contribute to Domestic Violence</a>)</p><p>The scientists tested the safety features of 10 different helmet models, measuring the accelerations, at impact, when the helmets were sped from these multiple distances and angles. The data yielded an overall STAR value — Summation of Tests for the Analysis of Risk — for each helmet. Taking these values, the Virginia Tech researchers created a ranking system: the safest helmet, the Riddell Revolution Speed, was assigned five stars — the top grade — and the least safe helmet, the Adams A2000 Pro Elite, was slapped with the label NR: Not Recommended.</p><p>A paper describing Virginia Tech’s methodology will be published in the <a href=#>Annals of Biomedical Engineering</a>.</p><p>This important work could shake up the helmet market. “For the first time, consumers can go to a <a href=#>website</a> and see which helmets have the best chance to reduce the risk of a concussion,” says Stefan Duma, a professor of biomedical engineering at Virginia Tech and head of the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.</p><p>The problem of concussion exists at every level of football, threatening players who sustain multiple hits with long-term brain injury. Recent studies of retired pro football players have shown that a history of concussion can lead to dementia-like brain damage associated with depression, suicidal tendencies and memory loss. Studies of former NFL players also show that they are at significantly higher risk of Alzheimer’s than the rest of the population.</p><p>(<strong>More on TIME.com:</strong> <a href=#>Football Searches for the Cause of Another Tragedy</a>)</p><p>Better helmets could mean less risk of concussion and brain damage. The 10 helmets rated by the Virginia Tech researchers were as follows:</p><p>Five Stars: Best Available<br>• Riddell Revolution Speed</p><p>Four Stars: Very Good<br>• Schutt ION 4D<br>• Schutt DNA Pro +<br>• Xenith X1<br>• Riddell Revolution<br>• Riddell Revolution IQ</p><p>Three Stars: Good<br>• Schutt Air XP</p><p>Two Stars: Adequate<br>• Schutt Air Advantage</p><p>One Star: Marginal<br>• Riddell VSR4</p><p>NR: Not Recommended<br>• Adams A2000 Pro Elite</p><p>Price was by no means the strongest predictor of safety. The Adams A2000 Pro Elite, with an NR rating, costs $199.95, while the four-star Riddell Revolution and Schutt DNA Pro + cost $182.99 and $169.95, respectively.</p><p>The <a href=#>detailed rankings</a> can be found on the <a href=#>school’s website</a>:&nbsp;follow the link for the “National Impact Database” on the top right of the page.</p><p>(<strong>More on TIME.com:</strong> <a href=#>Skip the Stretch Before Running — It Doesn’t Prevent Injuries</a>)</p><p>Last season, about half the team at Virginia Tech wore Riddell VSR4 helmets, which earned only a one-star, or “marginal,” ranking. The Hokies will upgrade to five-star Riddell Revolution Speed helmets this season.</p><p>Will the rest of the country do the same?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTLmqWdZqSeuqZ6wqikaGpgZn5wfJRoaGlno6nCpcWMq5ino6NifnF5xaimrZqRoblutMSlpJ6so2KzsL6MnKanm6WowKq7zWaqmp6VqcZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
