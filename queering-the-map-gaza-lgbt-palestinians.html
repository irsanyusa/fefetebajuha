The pink-colored atlas of community-sourced anecdotes, ranging from the raunchy to the heart-rending, has charted experiences across the world, <a href=#>in at least 28 languages</a>.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There are no timestamps on the messages, making it difficult to know when they were posted. Some share a general portrait of living as an LGBT person in the enclave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I know I was different from a young age. I knew I liked boys early on. But society demands it remains hidden. I live elsewhere now and I'm still trying to connect the dots. I wish things weren't this complicated. I don't want to hurt my family, but I cannot live a lie,” one post reads.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A post written in Arabic, geotagged in Central Gaza, reads: “The only thing that keeps me patient in Gaza is the sea and you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/queering-the-map-1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another, posted at the edge of a pier, reads: “A place [where] I kissed my first [crush]. Being gay in Gaza is hard but somehow it was fun. I made out with a lot of boys in my neighborhood. I thought everyone is gay to some level.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/queering-the-map-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many messages geotagged within Gaza express solidarity with the decades-long cause of Palestinian liberation.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Near the Nuseirat refugee camp, which was <a href=#>targeted by an apparent Israeli airstrike on Tuesday</a>, one post reads: “In solidarity with all my Palestinian brothers and sisters, you are all loved. Free Palestine.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another post from the southern city of Khan Younis, where <a href=#>hundreds of thousands of Gazans fled to</a> after evacuation orders in the north and <a href=#>which has also been bombarded by air raids</a>, reads: “Pls know despite what the media says there are gay Palestinians. We are here, we are queer. Free Palestine.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other messages are even more heartbreaking.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’ve always imagined you and me sitting out in the sun, hand and hand, free at last. We spoke of all the places we would go if we could,” reads a post tagged in the northern city of Jabalia, where <a href=#>a series of Israeli missiles last week destroyed a refugee camp</a> and <a href=#>reportedly killed dozens of people</a>. “Yet you are gone now. If I had known that bombs raining down on us would take you from me, I would have gladly told the world how I adored you more than anything. I’m sorry I was a coward.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/queering-the-map-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another post, which TIME could not verify on the Queering the Map site but may have existed and later been removed, made <a href=#>the rounds on social media</a> in recent days. Apparently tagged in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, it read, according to screenshots: “Idk how long I will live so I just want this to be my memory before I die. I am not going to leave my home, come what may. My biggest regret is not kissing this one guy. He died two days back. We had told how much we like each other and I was too shy to kiss last time. He died in the bombing. I think a big part of me died too. And soon I will be dead. To younus, i will kiss you in heaven.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Queering the Map allows <a href=#>content to be taken down upon request</a>, and founder LaRochelle said in <a href=#>an interview</a> that moderators block messages that include specific personal details like first and last names. (Queering the Map has not responded to TIME’s request for comment.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2Jrf3aAjqqsnp2inruoedOhnGalkaV6qK3ZmmSln5KperGty56qraGenq6vv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
